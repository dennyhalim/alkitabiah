"Jejak Darah..."





Melacak Jejak Kekristenan Sepanjang Abad . . . 

atau Sejarah Gereja Baptis Sejak Jaman Kristus,  

Sang Pendiri, hingga Saat Ini. 

oleh J. M. Caroll 

BUKU KECIL INI diadakan untuk memperkenalkan sejarah yang tidak banyak 
dikenal dari para SAKSI SETIA dari Tuhan Yesus yang sebagai anggota 
GEREJA YANG DIDIRIKAN YESUS, 
"Dan mereka mengalahkan dia oleh darah Anak Domba, dan oleh perkataan 
kesaksian mereka. Karena mereka tidak mengasihi nyawa mereka sampai ke 
dalam maut." Wahyu 12:11. 

Saya akan menghargai untuk mendengar darimu dan saya minta bantuanmu 
meneruskan pesan-pesan ini kepada generasi muda kita dan yang lainnya. 
Beritahu mereka fakta sejarah yang indah yang dituliskan di buku ini. 
Sarankan mereka untuk memesannya. Akan sangat membantu dalam 
pembelajaran seperti kelas-kelas di BTU, WMU dan organisasi lainnya. 





PENGANTAR 
Oleh CLARENCE WALKER 



I


Dr. J. M. Caroll, penulis buku ini, lahir di negara bagian Arkansas 
pada tanggal 8 Januari 1858 dan meninggal di Texas pada tanggal 10 
Januari 1931. Ayahnya adalah seorang pengkotbah Baptis, pindah ke Texas 
ketika Saudara Carroll berumur enam tahun. Disana, dia bertobat, 
dibaptis dan ditahbiskan sebagai penginjil. Dr. Carroll tidak hanya 
menjadi pemimpin kaum Baptis Texas, tetapi juga seorang tokoh Baptis 
Selatan, dan dunia.

Beberapa tahun lalu, dia mengunjungi gereja kami dan membawa pesan yang 
tertulis di buku ini. Pada saat itu saya sangat tertarik pada 
pembelajaran Saudara Carroll. Saya pun sudah membuat penyelidikan 
khusus dalam Sejarah Gereja, seperti apa Gereja mula-mula dan gereja-
gereja Perjanjian Baru.

Dr. J. W. Porter menghadiri kuliah tersebut. Dia begitu terkesan dia 
mengatakan pada Saudara Carroll kalau dia akan mencatat pesan-pesan dan 
dia akan menerbitkannya dalam sebuah buku. Dr. Carroll menuliskan 
kuliah dan memberi Dr. Porter hak untuk menerbitkannya bersama dengan 
grafik yang menggambarkan sejarah dengan sangat jelas.

Walaupun, Dr. Carroll meninggal sebelum buku terbit, tetapi Dr. Porter 
menerbitkan dan seluruh edisi segera terjual habis. Kini, oleh rahmat 
Tuhan, kita bisa mempersembahkan edisi ke-66 ini dari 20000. Saya ingin 
meminta semua yang membaca dan mempelajari halaman ini untuk bergabung 
dengan saya dalam doa dan pekerjaan supaya semakin banyak bisa 
diterbitkan.

dan untuk menyatakan apa isinya tugas penyelenggaraan rahasia yang 
telah berabad-abad tersembunyi dalam Allah, yang menciptakan segala 
sesuatu, supaya sekarang oleh jemaat diberitahukan pelbagai ragam 
hikmat Allah kepada pemerintah-pemerintah dan penguasa-penguasa di 
sorga ... bagi Dialah kemuliaan di dalam jemaat dan di dalam Kristus 
Yesus turun-temurun sampai selama-lamanya. Amin. (Efesus 3:9-10, 21)





II


Sangat mengagumkan mendengar Dr. Carroll menceritakan bagaimana dia 
menjadi tertarik dalam sejarah berbagai denominasi - KHUSUSNYA ASAL 
MEREKA. Dia menuliskan buku tersebut setelah dia berusia 70 tahun, 
tetapi dia mengatakan, "Saya bertobat kepada Tuhan ketika saya masih 
anak kecil. Saya melihat banyak denominasi dan berpikir gereja yang 
mana yang didirikan oleh Tuhan Yesus."

Bahkan saat masa mudanya dia merasa dalam pembelajaran Alkitab dan 
sejarah, dia bisa menemukan gereja mana yang tertua dan paling cocok 
dengan gereja yang dijelaskan dalam Perjanjian Baru.

Riset mencari kebenaran ini membawa dia ke banyak tempat dan dia 
berhasil mengumpulkan salah satu perpustakaan terbesar mengenai sejarah 
gereja. Perpustakaan ini diberikan setelah kematiannya kepada 
Soutwestern Baptist Seminary, Ft. Worth, Texas.

Dia menemukan banyak sejarah gereja, sebagian besar tentang Katolik dan 
Protestan. Jejak sejarah Baptis, dia temukan, tertulis dengan darah. 
Mereka adalah orang-orang yang dibenci pada Jaman Kegelapan. Pengkotbah 
mereka dan umatnya ditangkap dan tak terbilang banyaknya yang dihukum 
mati. Dunia belum melihat apa-apa dibandingkan kesengsaraan, 
pembantaian, banyaknya korban Baptis oleh Katolik selama Jaman 
Kegelapan. Paus adalah diktator dunia pada saat itu. Inilah sebabnya 
mengapa Ana-Baptis, sebelum Reformasi, menyebut Paus sebagai Anti 
Kristus.

Sejarah mereka tertulis dalam dokumen resmi dan kertas pada jaman itu. 
Dari catatan-catatan inilah "JEJAK DARAH" disusun 

"Di Zurich, setelah banyak debat antara pengikut Zuingli dengan Ana-
Baptis, senat membuat Keputusan, bahwa siapapun yang membaptis-ulang 
seseorang yang sudah pernah dibaptis (yaitu, saat bayi) maka mereka 
akan ditenggelamkan. Di Vienna banyak Ana-Baptis diikat berantaian 
sehingga seorang yang tenggelam akan menarik yang lainnya kedalam 
sungai, dimana mereka semua tenggelam." (Vida Supra, hal. 61)

Pada tahun Tuhan kita 1539 dua Ana-Baptis dibakar diluar Southwark, dan 
sebelum mereka 5 Ana-Baptis Belanda dibakar di Smithfield," (Fuller,
Sejarah Gereja.)

"Pada tahun 1160 kumpulan Pulician (Baptis) memasuki Oxford. Henry II 
memerintahkan mereka di-cap di dahi dengan besi panas, dicambuk didepan 
khalayak sepanjang jalan kota, menelanjangi mereka, dan dibiarkan di 
tengah kota. Penduduk tidak memberi mereka tempat tinggal atau makanan 
dan mereka perlahan-lahan mati karena kelaparan dan kedinginan."
(Moore, Earlier and Later Nonconformity in Oxford, hal. 12.) 

Si Chronicler Stowe tua, tahun 1533, mengisahkan:
"Tanggal 25 Mei di Gereja St. Paul, London mengusut 19 pria dan 6 
wanita. Empat belas dari mereka dihukum; seorang pria dan wanita 
dibakar di Smithfield, dua belas lainnya dibawa ke kota untuk dibakar."

Froude, sejarahwan Inggris, mengisahkan martir Ana-Baptis berikut:
"Semua detil lenyap, nama mereka tidak ada. Fakta langka yang layak di
jabarkan. Bagi mereka Eropa menggelisahkan, tidak ada perintah 
pengadilan untuk berkabung, tidak ada hati Paus yang gentar oleh 
kemarahan. Pada kematian mereka, dunia melihat dengan kepuasan, tidak 
perduli dan kebanggaan. Disini, dari 25 pria dan 14 wanita, mereka 
tidak akan mengakui apa yang tidak mereka percaya walaupun dengan 
segala macam teror, atau penyiksaan. Sejarah tidak memuji mereka, 
tetapi mereka tidak mengorbankan darah mereka dengan sia-sia. Hidup 
mereka mungkin tidak berguna seperti hidup semua orang. Dengan kematian 
mereka membayar harga dari kebebasan Inggris."

Begitupun, dalam tulisan musuh-musuh mereka maupun teman, Dr. Carroll 
menemukan jejak sejarah mereka sepanjang jaman memang sangat berdarah:

Kardinal Hosius (Katolik, 1524), Presiden Konsili Tren:
"Kalau saja para baptis tidak dibantai dengan sangat, dan dipotong 
dengan pisau sepanjang seribu dua ratus tahun, mereka akan sangat lebih 
banyak daripada semua Reformis." (Surat Hosius, Apud Opera, hal. 112,
113.)

Selamat "seribu dua ratus tahun" adalah tahun-tahun sebelum Reformasi 
dimana Roma membantai Baptis dengan siksaan yang paling kejam yang 
dapat dibayangkan.

Sir Isaac Newton:
"Baptis adalah satu-satunya Kristen yang tidak pernah disimbolkan 
dengan Roma."

Mosheim (Lutheran):
"Sebelum kebangkitan Luther dan Kalvin, secara rahasia di semua negara 
Eropa sudah ada mereka yang berdiri teguh dalam prinsip modern Baptis
Belanda."

Edinburg Cyclopedia (Presbyterian):
"Seharusnya sudah diketahui pembaca bahwa Bpatis adalah sekte Kristen 
yang sama yang sebelumnya disebut Ana-Baptis. Jelas ini menjadi prinsip 
utama mereka sejak jaman Tertullian hingga saat ini."

Tertullian dilahirkan sekitar lima puluh tahun setelah kematian Rasul 
Yohanes.





III


Baptis tidak percaya dengan Suksesi Rasul. Kerasulan berhenti dengan 
meninggalnya para Rasul. Hanya pada gerejaNya Dia menjanjikan akan 
terus-menerus ada sejak dari waktu Dia mengorganisir gereja pertama 
selama pelayanannya di dunia hingga saat Dia kembali. Dia berjanji:

"Aku akan mendirikan jemaat-Ku dan alam maut tidak akan menguasainya." 
(Matius 16:18)

Lalu, ketika Dia memberikan Amanat Agung, dimana Dia memberi petunjuk 
apa yang harus dikerjakan gerejaNya, Dia berjanji--
"Aku menyertai kamu senantiasa sampai kepada akhir zaman." (Mat 28:20)

Amanat ini, pekerjaan ini, tidak diberikan kepada individu Rasul, 
tetapi kepada mereka dan yang lainnya dalam kapasitas gereja mereka. 
Para Rasul dan yang lainnya yang mendengar Dia memberi Amanat ini tidak 
lama kemudian mati. TETAPI, GerejaNya terus berlangsung sepanjang masa, 
menjadikan murid-murid (menyelamatkan jiwa), membaptis mereka, dan 
mengajarkan kebenaran doktrin yang Dia terapkan kepada Gereja Yerusalem.
Gereja-gereja setia telah diberkati oleh kehadiranNya selama mereka 
meninggalkan JEJAK DARAH.

Sejarah ini menunjukkan bagaimana janji Tuhan kepada gerejaNya sudah 
dipenuhi. Dr. Carroll menunjukkan bahwa gereja ditemukan sepanjang masa 
yang sudah diajarkan doktrin yang Dia terapkan pada mereka. Dr. Carroll 
menyebut doktrin-doktrin ini sebagai "tanda" Gereja Perjanjian Baru.





"TANDA GEREJA PERJANJIAN BARU"


1. Didirikan dan dikepalai oleh KRISTUS. Dialah pemberi hukum; Gereja 
hanya pelaksana. (Mat 16:18; Kol 1:18)

2. ALKITAB satu-satunya aturan iman dan praktek. (2Tim 3:15-17)

3. Disebut "Gereja" "Gereja-gereja" (Mat 16:18; Wahyu 22:16)

4. Semua jemaat sama. (Mat 20:24-28; 23:5-12)

5. Jemaat hanya terdiri dari mereka yang sudah bertobat. (Efesus 2:21;
1Pet 2:5)

6. Peringatan hanya Baptisan orang percaya dan Perjamuan Tuhan. 
(Mat 28:19-20)

7. Pelayanan hanya oleh Pastor dan Diaken. (1Tim 3:1-16)

8. Pelayanannya untuk menyelamatkan jiwa, membaptis (dengan baptisan 
yang memenuhi semua perintah Tuhan), mengajar ("dan ajarlah mereka 
melakukan segala sesuatu yang telah Kuperintahkan kepadamu.") 
(Mat 28:16-20)

9. Perencanaan keuangannya. "Demikian pula Tuhan telah menetapkan, 
bahwa mereka yang memberitakan Injil, harus hidup dari pemberitaan 
Injil itu." (1Kor 9:14)

10. Senjata untuk pertempuran rohani, bukan fisik/jasmani. (2Kor 10:4;
Efesus 6:10-20)

11. Pemisahan Gereja dan Negara. (Mat 22:21)





IV 


Di kota manapun, ada banyak gereja yang mengaku sebagai gereja yang 
benar. Dr. Carroll menyelidiki seperti yang bisa kamu lakukan sekarang 
dengan "tanda", atau pengajaran dari berbagai gereja dan mencari gereja 
yang mempunyai "tanda" atau doktrin yang benar. Gereja yang mempunyai 
"tanda" ini atau doktrin yang diajarkan Firman Tuhan, adalah gereja 
yang benar.


Ini, sudah dilakukan Dr. Carroll kepada gereja-gereja sepanjang masa. 
Dia menemukan banyak gereja sudah menyimpang dari "tanda" atau doktrin. 
Gereja lain dia temukan selalu berpegang teguh pada "tanda" ini 
sepanjang sejarah dan sejak Yesus berkata,

"Aku akan mendirikan jemaat-Ku dan alam maut tidak akan menguasainya."
(Mat 16:18)

"Aku menyertai kamu senantiasa sampai kepada akhir zaman." (Mat 28:20)






"JEJAK DARAH"


Melacak Jejak Kekristenan Sepanjang Abad
Sejak Jaman Kristus, hingga Saat Ini. 


dengan kata lain --

"Sejarah Doktrin seperti yang diajarkan Kristus dan para Rasul dan 
semua yang setiap padanya."





KULIAH PERTAMA


"Ingatlah kepada zaman dahulu kala, perhatikanlah tahun-tahun keturunan 
yang lalu, tanyakanlah kepada ayahmu, maka ia memberitahukannya 
kepadamu, kepada para tua-tuamu, maka mereka mengatakannya kepadamu."
(Ulangan 32:7)


1. Apa yang kita kenal harini sebagai "Kekristenan" atau agama Kristen, 
dimulai dengan Kristus, tahun 25-39 pada jaman Kekaisaran Romawi. Salah 
satu kerajaan terbesar yang pernah dikenal dunia sepanjang masa.

2. Kerajaan pada masa ini menguasai hampir seluruh dunia. Tiberius 
Caesar sebagai Raja.

3. Pada saat itu Kerajaan Romawi adalah penyembah berhala. Agama dengan 
banyak dewa. Beberapa berwujud dan beberapa hasil imajinasi. Banyak 
yang sangat taat beragama. Bukan hanya agama rakyat, tetapi kerajaan. 
Agama yang mapan. Disahkan hukum dan didukung oleh pemerintah. (Mosheim, 
Vol. 1, Bab. 1.)

4. Bangsa Yahudi, pada saat itu bukan satu bangsa, tetapi terserak ke 
seluruh Kerajaan Roma. Mereka mempunyai Bait Allah di Yerusalem, dan 
disana mereka menyembah Allah. Tetapi, seperti penyembah berhala, 
mereka sudah lama menyimpang kepada ibadah formalitas yang kehilangan 
kuasa. (Mosheim, Vol. 1, Bab. 2.)

5. Agama Kristen bukan dari dunia ini, Pendirinya tidak memberikan 
pemimpin dan kuasa sementara. Tidak mencari dukungan pemerintah. Tidak 
mencari pengganti Kaisar. Tuhan berfirman, "Berikanlah kepada Kaisar 
apa yang wajib kamu berikan kepada Kaisar dan kepada Allah apa yang 
wajib kamu berikan kepada Allah." (Mat 22:19-22; Mar 12:17; Luk 20:20). 
Sebagai agama rohani, Kristen tidak menyaingi pemerintahan dunia. Dan 
mengajarkan untuk menghargai semua hukum sipil dan pemerintah. 
(Rom 13:1-7; Tit 3:1; 1Pet 2:13-16)

6. Saya ingin perhatianmu pada patokan, atau tanda agama ini, agama 
Kristen. Jika kamu dan saya menyelidikinya sepanjang 20 abad dan 
terutama selama 1200 tahun kesuraman malam, digelapkan oleh sungai dan 
lautan dara martir, maka kita perlu mengerti tanda-tanda ini dengan 
baik. Seringkali terjadi penyimpangan. Tetapi akan selalu ada bukti-
bukti nyata. Hal ini harus kita perhatikan dan doakan dengan sungguh. 
Kita akan menjumpai banyak kepalsuan. Jika memungkinkan, orang pilihan 
akan dikhianati dan ditipu. Kita ingin, jika memungkinkan, melacak 
sejarah yang terpercaya, tapi lebih khususnya melacak Firman Tuhan yang 
pasti dan tidak ada kesalahan.






Beberapa Tanda Kebenaran, yang tidak bisa salah


Berhati-hatilah jika dalam melacak sejarah kita menemukan kelompok 
orang yang tidak mempunyai tanda ini dan mengajarkan hal lain sebagai 
doktrin pokok.

1. Kristus, pendiri agama ini, mengorganisasikan pengikutNya dalam
Gereja. Dan murid-murid mengorganisasi gereja-gereja lain dan 
menyebarkan agama dan "menghasilkan" murid-murid. (Ray, Bapt, 
Succession, Revised Edition, Bab. 1.)

2. Organisasi ini atau gerja, menurut Alkitab dan pengajaran para Rasul
dan gereja mula-mula, hanya diberikan dua posisi, yaitu Pastor dan 
Diaken. Pastor juga disebut Uskup, Gembala, Pendeta. Keduanya dipilih 
oleh gereja dan melayani gereja.

3. Gereja dalam pemerintahan dan disiplin, adalah terpisah dan 
independen satu terhadap yang lainnya, Yerusalem tidak mempunyai 
otoritas terhadap Antiokia atau Antiokia terhadap Efesus atau Efesus 
terhadap Korintus, dst. Dan pemerintahannya bersifat demokrasi. 
Pemerintahan oleh rakyat, dari rakyat, dan untuk rakyat.

4. Kepada gereja hanya diberikan dua dan hanya dua ordinan, baptis dan 
Perjamuan Tuhan. Untuk dijalankan terus sebagai peringatan.

5. Hanya yang sudah bertobat yang dapat diterima sebagai anggota jemaat 
gereja (Kisah 2:47). Yang selamat adalah diselamatkan hanya oleh iman 
tanpa perbuatan hukum (Efesus 2:5, 8, 9). Hanya yang sudah selamat dan 
hanya mereka saja, diselamkan dalam nama Bapa, Putera dan Roh Kudus 
(Mat 28:19). Dan hanya mereka yang diterima dan dibaptis yang ikut 
bagian dalam Perjamuan Tuhan, dan perjamuan hanya diadakan oleh gereja,
didalam kapasitas gereja.

6. Alkitab satu-satunya yang diilhamkan, Perjanjian Baru adalah aturan 
dan petunjuk iman dan kehidupan, tidak hanya untuk gereja sebagai 
organisasi, tetapi juga untuk setiap individu sebagai anggota dari 
organisasi itu.

7. Kristus Yesus, pendiri organisasi dan juruselamat umatNya, adalah 
satu-satunya imam dan raja, satu-satunya Tuhan dan pemberi hukum, satu-
satunya kepala gereja. Gereja sebagai eksekutif hanya untuk menjalankan 
kehendak Tuhan dan menggenapi hukum, bukan legislative, yang boleh 
merubah atau membatalkan hukum atau menciptakan hukum baru.

8. Agama dari Kristus ini adalah pilihan pribadi dan sukarela dengan 
melalui ajakan. Tidak menggunakan pemaksaan fisik ataupun pemerintah. 
Masalah individu dan pilihan pribadi. "Pilihanmu" adalah perintah 
alkitab. Tidak boleh diterima ataupun ditolak karena paksaan.

9. Tandai dengan benar! Tidak pernah Kristus ataupun para Rasul 
memberikan nama denominasi, seperti "Katolik", "Luther", "Presbyterian", 
"Episcopal", dan seterusnya, kecuali nama yang diberikan Kristus kepada 
Yohanes, "Baptis". Yohanes Baptis (Mat 11:11 dan belasan kali lainnya.) 
Kristus memanggil pengikut individu sebagai "murid". Beberapa pengikut 
disebut "murid-murid". Organisasi para murid, seperti di Yerusalem, atau 
Antiokia atau tempat lainnya disebut Gereja. Jika lebih dari satu 
organisasi, disebut gereja-gereja. Kata gereja sebagai kata tunggal 
tidak pernah digunakan untuk menunjuk pada lebih dari satu organisasi. 
Juga tidak pernah untuk menunjuk pada semua organisasi secara 
keseluruhan.

10. Satu tanda untuk lebih memberi perbedaan. Kita sebut sebagai 
pemisahan Gereja dan Negara. Tidak ada kombinasi antara agama rohani 
dengan kekuasaan sementara di dunia. "Kebebasan Beragama" untuk semua.

Dan kini, sebelum memasuki topik sejarah, kita perhatikan..


GRAFIK


Saya yakin, jika anda mempelajari grafik ini dengan cermat, anda akan 
memahami sejarah dengan lebih benar, dan ini akan sangat membantu 
mengingat apa yang anda dengar dan lihat.


Ingat grafik ini meliputi jangka waktu dua ribu tahun sejarah gereja.

Perhatian di atas dan bawah grafik, terdapat angka yang sama
100, 200, 300, dst sampai 2,000. 

Ini menunjukkan jangka waktu dua puluh abad dengan garis vertikal 
sebagai pembatas abad.

Perhatikan grafik, dekat bawah; ada garis lain, garis dari kiri ke kanan 
sepanjang grafik.

Garis ini mempunyai jarak yang hampir sama. Tetapi anda tidak bisa 
melihat semua. Garis ini tertutup titik titik yang sangat gelap, 
mewakili sejarah yang dikenal sebagai "jaman kegelapan". Ini akan di
jelaskan nanti. Antara dua garis terbawah adalah nama negara . . .
Italia, Wales, Inggris, Spanyol, Perancis dan seterusnya hingga Amerika. 
Ini adalah nama negara dimana sejarah terjadi pada periode yang tertulis 
nama tersebut. Tentu saja, beberapa sejarah terjadi di negara lain pada 
setiap periode. Tetapi sejarah khusus terjadi pada negara tersebut, pada 
periode tersebut.

Perhatikan lagi, dekat bawah grafik, garis lain yang lebih tinggi. Ini, 
pun, ditutupi oleh "jaman kegelapan" dan juga penuh dengan nama, tetapi 
bukan nama negara. Nama itu adalah penamaan yang diberikan oleh musuh 
mereka. "Kristen" adalah yang pertama: "Di Antiokhialah murid-murid itu 
untuk pertama kalinya disebut Kristen." (Kisah Para Rasul 11:26). Ini 
terjadi sekitar tahun 43. Baik penyembah berhala, maupun Yahudi 
menamakan mereka demikian sebagai ejekan. Semua nama disini pun sama 
Montanis, Novationis, Donatis, Paulician, Albigenses, Waldenses, dst., 
dan Ana-Baptis. Semua ini akan dirujuk kembali selama kuliah berlangsung.


Lihat kembali pada grafik.  Lihat lingkaran-lingkaran merah. Mereka 
tersebar hampir diseluruh grafik. Mereka mewakili gereja. Satu gereja 
individu di Asia, di Afrika, di Eropa, di gunung dan lembah, dst. Warna 
merah darah itu mewakili darah para martir. Kristus yang medirikan sudah 
mati di salib. Kecuali Yohanes dan Yudas, semua rasul mati sebagai 
martir. Yudas mengkhianati Tuhan dan bunuh diri. Rasul Yohanes, menurut 
sejarah, dimasukkan kedalam minyak panas.

Perhatikan juga beberapa lingkaran adalah hitam pekat. Ini juga mewakili 
gereja. Tetapi adalah gereja sesat. Gereja yang menyimpang dari doktrin. 
Ada banyak gereja sesat bahkan sebelum kematian Petrus, Paulus dan 
Yohanes.

Setelah merangkum pengantar umumm dan beberapa topik utama, saya 
sampaikan sejarahnya





PERIODE PERTAMA: TAHUN 30-500


1. Dibawah kepemimpinan Yohanes Baptis yang penuh semangat, pria fasih 
dari gurun, dibawah kasih dan kuasa Kristus sendiri dan pengajaran dari 
12 Rasul dan penerus mereka, agama Kristen menyebar dengan cepat selama 
periode 500 tahun pertama. Tetapi, meninggalkan jejak sejarah berdarah. 
Yahudi dan penyembah berhala menghalangi setiap gerakan. Yohanes Baptis 
adalah pemimpin besar pertama yang memberikan nyawanya. Kepalanya 
dipenggal. Segera setelah dia, Sang Juruselamat sendiri, pendiri agama 
Kristen. Dia mati disalib, sengsara hingga mati disalib.

2. Mengikuti Juruselmat, dengan cepat berjatuhan pahlawan iman: Stefanus 
dilempari batu, Matius dibunuh di Etiopia, Markus ditarik sepanjang 
jalan hingga mati, Lukas digantung, Petrus dan Simeon disalib, Andreas 
diikat pada salib, Yakobus dipenggal, Filipus disalib dan dilempari batu, 
Bartolomeus dikuliti hidup-hidup, Tomas ditombaki, Yakobus, yang lain, 
dilempar dari menara dan dipukuli hingga mati, Yudas dipanah hingga mati, 
Matius dilempari batu hingga mati dan Paulus dipengggal.

3. Setelah lebih dari seratus tahun berlalu pembantaian oleh Yahudi dan 
penyembah berhala tetap berlanjut selama dua abad. Tetapi agama Kristen 
tetap menyebar dengan sangat cepat. Menyebar ke seluruh kerajaan Romawi, 
Eropa, Asia, Afrika, Inggris, Wales dan hampir semua tempat, dimana ada 
peradaban. Gereja berlipat ganda dan murid-murid terus bertambah. Tetapi 
beberapa gereja terus menyimpang dari kebenaran.

4. Perubahan pertama dari pengajaran Perjanjian Baru meliputi 
kebijaksanaan dan doktrin. Dalam dua abad pertama, gereja-gereja 
berlipat ganda dengan cepat dan beberapa gereja mula-mula, seperti 
Yerusalem, Antiokia, Efesus, Korintus, dsb., menjadi sangat besar; 
Yerusalem saja mempunyai ribuan murid (Kisah 2:41; 4:4; 5:14), mungkin 
25000 atau bahkan 50000 atau lebih. Seorang murid pada buku Kisah Para 
Rasul dan Surat-surat Paulus melihat Paulus bekerja keras bahkan pada 
jamannya supaya gereja tetap dalam kebenaran. Petrus dan Paulus pun 
sudah menubuatkan masa depan gereja (2Pet 2:12; Kisah 20:29-31. Lihat 
juga Wahyu bab dua dan tiga).

Gereja-gereja besar ini membutuhkan banyak pengkotbah dan gembala (Kisah 
20:17). Beberapa gembala atau pastor mulai mengambil kekuasaan yang 
tidak diberikan pada mereka dalam Perjanjian Baru. Mereka mulai menuntut 
kekuasaan diatas gereja-gereja lain dan yang lebih kecil. Mereka, dengan 
banyak gembala, mulai ingin mengepalai peninggalan Tuhan (3Yoh 1:9). 
Disinilah mulainya tingkat-tingkat kedudukan dalam pelayanan dan 
berkembang hingga menjadi praktek yang sekarang dilakukan seperti oleh 
Katolik. Disini mulai perubahan menyeluruh dari awalnya kebijaksanaan 
dan pemerintahan demokrasi pada gereja mula-mula. Kesesatan ini dimulai 
dari kecil, bahkan sebelum abad kedua berakhir. Ini mungkin adalah 
penyimpangan serius yang pertama dari aturan gereja Perjanjian Baru.

5. Perubahan berbahaya lainnya mulai terjadi sejak akhir abad kedua 
adalah pada doktrin Keselamatan itu sendiri. Yahudi dan penyembah 
berhala sudah turun temurun terlatih dalam melaksanakan adat istiadat. 
Mereka melihat tipologi sebagai anti-tipologi, bayangan sebagai hakekat 
yang benar, upacara sebagai alat keselamatan. Begitu mudah menyimpulkan 
itu dari baptisan. Alasan mereka: Alkitab banyak membahas mengenai 
baptisan. Banyak menekankan aturan dan tugas orang mengenai hal ini. 
Tentu ini berhubungan dengan keselamatan. Begitulah, pada periode ini 
ide "Baptis Menyelamatkan" mulai dipegang teguh oleh beberapa gereja. 
(Shackelford, hal. 57; Camp hal. 47; Benedict, hal. 286; Mosheim, vol. 1, 
hal. 134; Christian, hal. 28.) 

6. Kesalahan serius berikutnya menyelinap, menurut beberapa sejarahwan 
sudah mulai sejak abad ini juga dan merupakan konsekuensi tak terelakkan 
dari ide "baptis menyelamatkan", adalah perubahan subyek baptisan. 
Karena baptisan dianggap menyelamatkan oleh gereja sesat ini, maka lebih 
cepat dibaptis akan lebih baik. Sehingga timbullah "baptisan bayi". 
Sebelum ini, baptisan hanya orang percaya dan hanya untuk orang percaya. 
Kemudian "percing" dan "tuang" pun diterapkan. Hal ini diterapkan lebih 
telat. Selama berabad-abad, bayi, seperti yang lainnya, diselam. Katolik 
Yunani (pecahan gereja Katolik) tetap melakukan baptis selam hingga kini. 
Walaupun mereka membaptis bayi, tetapi tetap dengan baptisan selam. 
(Beberapa sejarahwan gereja mencatat baptisan bayi dalam abad ini, 
tetapi saya akan mengutip satu alinea singkat dari Robinson's 
Ecclesiastical Researches.)

Selama tiga abad pertama, seluruh jemaat Timur terpisah dan tidak di
dukung oleh pemerintah sehingga tidak mempunyai kuasa diatas yang lain. 
Selama ini mereka adalah gereja baptis dan walaupun semua ayah hingga 
Jerome (tahun 370), Yunani, Siria, dan Afrika dan mereka mempunyai 
sejarah baptisan, tetapi tidak ada baptisan bayi hingga tahun 370.
(Compendium of Baptist History, Shackelford, hal. 43; Vedder, hal. 50; 
Christian, hal. 31; Orchard, hal. 50, dsb.) 

7. Perlu diingat bahwa penyimpangan-penyimpangan ini tidak terjadi dalam 
satu hari atau bahkan satu tahun. Penyimpangan terjadi perlahan dan 
tidak pernah dalam seluruh gereja. Beberapa gereja menolak dengan keras. 
Hingga tahun 251, gereja-gereja setia menyatakan terpisah dari gereja 
yang menerima dan melaksanakan penyimpangan ini. Sehingga terjadi 
pemisahan resmi pertama antar gereja.

8. Perlu dicatat bahwa selama tida abad pertama tiga penyimpangan utama 
dari pengajaran Kristus dan RasulNya sudah dimulai. Dan satu peristiwa 
penting terjadi, Perhatikan rangkuman dan ringkasan ini:

  (1) Perubahan ide dari pastor dan gereja Perjanjian Baru. Perubahan 
  ini berkembang cepat, lebih dinyatakan dan lengkap dan menyakitkan.
  
  (2) Perubahan pengajaran Keselamatan menurut Perjanjian Baru menjadi 
  "Baptis Menyelamatkan"
  
  (3) Perubahan dari baptisan orang percaya menjadi baptisan bayi (Hal 
  ini, tidak menjadi umum atau sering dari abad lain).
  
  
9. "Baptis Menyelematakan" dan "baptis bayi". Kedua penyimpangan ini, 
menurut sejarah, menyebabkan pertumpahan lebih banyak darah Kristen, 
sepanjang sejarah, dibandingkan semua penyimpangan lain digabungkan, 
atau mungkin semua perang diluar pembantaian, jika tidak menghitung 
"Perang Dunia". Lebih dari 50 JUTA Kristen mati martir, terutama di
sebabkan mereka menolak kedua penyimpangan ini selama "masa kegelapan" 
saja sekitar dua belas atau tiga belas abad.

10. Tiga fakta penting untuk mayoritas gereja jelas ditunjukkan dalam 
sejarah  selama tiga abad pertama.

  (1) Pemisahan dan Independensi Gereja
  (2) Ketaatan Pastor atau Gembala
  (3) Baptisan orang percaya


Saya kutip dari Mosheim - sejarahwan gereja Luther terbesar. Vol.1 hal. 
71 dan 72:
"Siapapun menganggap bahwa pastor jaman emas ini menyesuaikan dengan 
pastor jaman berikutnya harus berbaur dan dengan karakter berbeda, 
dari abad ini dan selanjutnya, pastor memimpin gereja tunggal, dimana 
biasanya didalam satu rumah pribadi; dia bukan Tuan, tetapi pelayan ...
Semua gereja pada jaman itu adalah independen, tidak ada dari mereka 
yang berada dibawah kuasa gereja lain. Karena walaupun gereja-gereja 
yang didirikan oleh para Rasul sendiri serigkali dihormati dan diminta 
nasihat untuk kasus-kasus rumit, tetapi mereka tidak mempunyai kuasa 
otoritas, kontrol, kuasa memberi hukum. Sebaliknya, jelas bahwa gereja-
gereja Kristen mempunyai hak yang sama dan kuasa yang sama."

11. Hingga periode ini, dengan banyak penganiayaan serius, Kriten terus 
berkembang pesat. Kristen telah memenuhi dan jauh melampaui Kerajaan 
Romawi. Hampir, jika bukan seluruh dunia sudah mendengar Injil. Dan, 
menurut beberapa sejarahwan gereja, beberapa gereja mula-mula yang di
organisir para Rasul masih berdiri dan tetap setia pada pengajaran Rasul.
Tetapi, seperti terlihat, banyak tanda dan penyimpangan menyakitkan 
telah merayap dan menjadi kesalahan permanen pada banyak gereja. 
Beberapa gereja menjadi sangat sesat.

12. Penganiayaan menjadi semakin pahit. Mendekati awal abad ke empat 
mungkin adalah pembantaian pemerintah yang pertama. Pertumbuhan pesat 
Kriste mengkhawatirkan pemimpin Kerajaan Romawi yang menyembah berhala. 
Kaisar Gelerius memerintahkan pembantaian. Hal ini terjadi pada 24 Feb 
tahun 303. Sebelum ini penyembah berhala melaksanakan pembantaian tanpa 
adanya hukum resmi yang berlaku.

13. Dekrit pembantaian ini gagal menghentikan pertumbuhan pesat Kristen, 
sehingga Kaisar Galerius, setelah delapan tahun (tahun 311) mengeluarkan 
dekrit yang membatalkan dekrit pertama dan malah memberi ijin toleransi 
untuk agama dari Yesus Kristus. Mungkin ini adalah pertama kali hukum 
mendukung.

14. Pada awal tahun 313, Kristen menang telak atas penyembah berhala. 
Kaisar baru naik tahta Kerajaan Romawi. Jelas dia melihat suatu kuasa 
bear atas agama ini yang terus berkembang pesat walaupun dibantai. 
Sejarah mencatat Kaisar ini adalah Konstantin yang mempunyai penglihatan.
Dia melihat salib merah menyala di langit dan pada salib ada tulisan 
menyala: "Dengan ini kamu menaklukkan" 
(catatan penerjemah: baca Matius 24:23-26) 
Dia menganggap ini berarti dia harus menjadi Kristen. Dan dengan melepas 
penyembahan berhala dan menggabungkan kuasa agama Kristen kedalam kuasa 
duniawi Kerajaan Roma maka seluruh dunia bisa ditaklukkan. Sehingga 
agama Kristen bahkan bisa menjadi agama dunia, dan Kerajaan Romawi 
menguasai seluruh dunia.

15. Dibawah kekuasaan Kaisar Konstantin terjadi damai, pacaran dan 
perkawinan. Kerajaan Romawi melalui kaisarnya mencari perkawinan dengan 
Kristen. Beri kami kuasa roh dan kami memberi kuasa duniawi.

16. Agar persatuan sesat ini efektif, diadakanlah konsili. Pada tahun 
313, seluruh gereja Kristen atau perwakilannya diundang. Banyak, tetapi 
tidak semua datang. Persatuan sesat terjadi. Hirarki dibentuk. Dalam 
organisasi hirarki ini, tahta Kristus sebagai kepala gereja dicabut dan 
Kaisar Konstantin diberi tahta (sementara) sebagai kepala gereja.

17. Hirarki pastinya hanyalah awal dari penyesatan yang akhirnya 
menghasilkan apa yang kini dikenal sebagai Katolik, atau gereja umum / 
universal. Permulaannya adalah antara mendekati akhir abad kedua dan 
awal abad ketiga, ketika ide baru mengenai pastor dan pengkotbah - 
pemerintahan gereja mulai terbentuk.

18. Perlu diingat bahwa ketika Konstantin mengadakan konsili, banyak 
sekali Kristen (Baptis) dan gereja-gerejanya yang menolak terlibat. 
Mereka menolak perkawinan gereja dengan negara, dan tidak ada pemerintah 
agama, dan tidak ada gereja negara, yang ada hanyalah gereja individu / 
independen. Kristen ini (Baptis) ataupun gereja-gereja sesudahnya, tidak 
pernah masuk dalam hirarki denominasi Katolik.

19. Ketika hirarki dibentuk, Konstantin sendiri, sebagai kepala gereja, 
bukan seorang Kristen. Dia setuju mau menjadi Kristen. Tetapi karena 
kesalahan atau kesesatan gereja dalam organisasinya yang mengajarkan 
Baptis menyelamatkan, satu pertanyaan serius timbul dalam benaknya, 
"Jika saya diselamatkan dari dosa dengan baptisan, bagaimana dengan dosa 
yang saya lakukan setelah dibaptis?" Dia memberi pertanyaan yang 
memusingkan dunia hingga generasi berikutnya. Dapatkah baptis 
membersihkan dosa yang belum dilakukan? Atau, apakah dosa yang dilakukan 
sebelum dibaptis dibersihkan dengan satu cara (yaitu baptis), dan dosa 
yang dilakukan setelah dibaptis dibersihkan dengan cara lain?

20. Tidak sanggup memberikan jawaban yang memuaskan pada banyak 
pertanyaan yang muncul, Konstantin akhirnya memutuskan masuk Kristen, 
tetapi menunda baptisan sampai mendekati ajalnya, supaya semua dosanya 
bisa dibersihkan sekaligus. Cara inilah yang diterapkannya, jadi dia 
dibaptis saat menjelang kematiannya.

21. Tindakan Konstantin menentang penyembahan berhala dan menerima 
Kristen menyebabkan ketidaksenangan Senat Romawi. Mereka menentang, atau 
setidaknya menolak caranya. Dan pertentangan mereka akhirnya menyebabkan 
pindahkan tahta kaisar dari Roma ke Byzantium, sebuah kota tua dibangun 
kembali dan kemudian diberi nama Konstantinopel dari nama Konstantin. 
Hasilnya adalah dua ibukota Kerajaan Romawi, yaitu Roma dan 
Konstantinopel. Kedua kota bersaing dan beberapa abad kemudian menjadi 
pusat pemerintahan dari perpecahan gereja Katolik yaitu Katolik Roma dan 
Katolik Yunani.

22. Sebelum dibentuknya hirarki organisasi kesatuan gereja dan negara, 
semua pembantaian Kristen dilakukan oleh Yahudi dan penyembah berhala. 
Kini, terjadi perubahan serius. Kristen (dalam nama) mulai membantai 
Kristen. Konstantin bernafsu menyatukan semua Kristen untuk bergabung 
dengannya dalam ide baru agama negara, dan banyak yang menentang keras 
penyesatan dari pengajaran Perjanjian Baru ini, sehingga dia  mulai 
menggunakan kekuasaan pemerintah untuk memaksa. Mulailah hari-hari dan 
tahun-tahun bahkan abad-abad kekerasan dan pembantaian terhadap semua 
Kristen yang setia pada ajaran awal Kristus dan para Rasul.

23. Ingat bahwa kita kini mencatat peristiwa antara tahun 300 dan 500. 
Organisasi Hirarki dibawah kepemimpinan Konstantin, dengan cepat 
berkembang menjadi apa yang kini disebut sebagai gereja Katolik. Gereja 
yang baru berkembang ini bersama kekuasaan pemerintah duniawi, bukan 
lagi eksekutif yang menjalankan hukum Perjanjian Baru, mulai menjadi 
legislative, merubah dan membatalkan hukum atau menciptakan yang baru 
yang tidak diperintahkan dalam Perjanjian Baru.

24. Salah satu hukum baru yang diciptakan, dan salah satu yang paling 
subversif adalah menciptakan hukum "baptisan bayi". Dengan hukum baru 
ini, "baptisan bayi" menjadi wajib. Ini diterapkan pada tahun 416. 
Sekitar satu abad sebelum hukum ini, bayi sangat jarang dibaptis. Dengan 
hukum baru ini, dua hukum Perjanjian Baru dibatalkan, yaitu "Baptisan 
orang percaya" dan "Sukarela memberi diri dibaptis".

25. Akibat yang tidak bisa ditolak dari doktrin dan hukum baru ini, 
gereja sesat ini dengan cepat mendapat umat yang tidak bertobat. Bahkan, 
tidak perlu waktu lama hingga hampir semua umat adalah orang yang tidak 
bertobat. Jadi kerajaan rohani Allah kini ada ditangan penguasa duniawi. 
Kini, apa yang bisa kita harapkan?

26. Kristen dan gereja-gereja setia, tentu saja menolak hukum baru ini. 
"Baptisan orang percaya", tentu saja "Baptisan Perjanjian Baru" adalah 
satu-satunya hukum bagi mereka. Tidak saja mereka menolak membaptis 
anak-anak mereka, tetapi mereka percaya hanya pada baptisan orang 
percaya, mereka menolak menerima baptisan yang dilakukan oleh gereja-
gereja sesat ini. Jika ada umat dari gereja sesat ini yang mau bergabung 
dengan gereja yang benar, maka harus didahului pertobatan kemudian 
dibaptis dengan benar.

27. Cara yang diterapkan gereja-gereja benar ini segera menimbulkan 
ketidaksenangan agama negara yang sebagian besar dari mereka bukan 
pengikut Kristus yang benar. Kemudian mereka menolak menamai "Kristen" 
pada gereja-gereja setia yang menolak penyesatan mereka. Dan menamai 
mereka dengan banyak nama, "Montanis", "Tertullianis", "Novationis", 
"Paterines", dsb., dan beberapa disebabkan praktek mereka membaptis 
ulang mereka yang dibaptis saat bayi, mereka disebut "Ana-Baptis" 
(artinya baptis ulang)

28. Tahun 426, hanya sepuluh tahun sesudah hukum resmi baptis bayi, masa 
suram yang disebut "Jaman Kegelapan" dimulai. Masa itu! Begitu gelap dan 
berdarah! Dari saat ini hingga lebih dari sepuluh abad, jejak dari 
Kristen setia dibasuh dalam darah. Perhatikan pada grafik beberapa nama 
timbul dari pembantaian. Kadang-kadang nama diberikan karena beberapa 
pemimpin pahlawan dan kadang-kadang oleh alasan lain dan seringkali nama 
yang sama di negara yang berbeda dan bahkan abad yang berbeda.

29. Pada awal periode "jaman kegelapan" ketika kepausan sebenarnya 
dimulai. Dimulai oleh Leo II, tahun 440 hingga 461. Tapi ini bukanlah 
pertama kali gelar kepausan digunakan. Gelar ini, seperti gereja Katolik 
selalu berkembang. Pertama kali gelar ini diberikan kepada uskup Roma 
tahun 296-304. Secara resmi diadaptasi oleh Siricius, uskup Roma 384-398. 
Lalu Leo II tahun 440-461. Kemudian dinyatakan umum pada tahun 707. 
Beberapa abad kemudian dideklarasikan oleh Gregory VII menjadi hak 
eksklusif kepausan.

30. Rangkuman peristiwa terpenting selama lima abad pertama:
  
  (1) Penyesatan perlahan dari demokrasi menjadi pemerintahan gereja
  (2) Penyesatan dari Keselamatan oleh Kasih menjadi Baptis menyelamatkan
  (3) Penyesatan dari baptisan orang percaya menjadi baptisan bayi
  (4) Organisasi hirarki. Perkawinan gereja dan negara.
  (5) Tahta kerajaan pindah ke Konstantinopel.
  (6) Baptisan bayi menjadi hukum wajib.
  (7) Kristen (sesat) membantai Kristen (yang setia)
  (8) Jaman Kegelapan mulai tahun 426.
  (9) Pedang dan Obor menggantikan injil kuasa Tuhan (?) menyelamatkan.
  (10) Kebebasan Beragama mati dan dikubur selama beberapa abad.
  (11) Gereja Perjanjian Baru yang setia, dinamai apapun, dikejar dan 
  diburu tanpa batas oleh penguasa duniawi Katolik. Sisa jemaat tersebar 
  ke seluruh dunia mencari perlindungan didalam hutan dan gunung, lembah, 
  celah dan gua di bumi.
  
  
  


KULIAH KEDUA: TAHUN 600-1300


1. Kita tutup kuliah perta dengan menutup abad kelima. Akan tetapi 
banyak hal terjadi dan dimulai sejak abad-abad awal, yang belum pernah 
disinggung dalam kuliah pertama. Kita baru saja memasuki periode 
mengerikan yang dikenal dengan "Jaman Kegelapan". Gelap dan berdarah dan 
mengerikan dengan sangat amat. Pembantaian dilakukan oleh Katolik Roma.

Gereja keras, kejam dan tak terbendung. Perang rencana pemusnahan tanpa 
henti ke banyak tempat Kristen melarikan diri. Hanya "Jejak Darah" yang 
tersisa dimana-mana. Khususnya sepanjang Inggris, Wales, Afrika, Armenia, 
dan Bulgaria. Dan dimanapun Kristen bisa ditemukan yang berusaha tetap 
setia kepada pengajaran Perjanjian Baru.

2. Kini kita perhatikan konsili yang disebut "Ekumene" atau Kerajaan 
luas. Baik diingat bahwa konsili ini didasarkan pada konsili yang 
diadakan para Rasul di Yerusalem (lihat Kisah 15:1), tapi sepertinya 
hanya namanya saja yang sama. Kini perhatikan pada konsili kedelapan,
dan semua ini diadakan oleh Kaisar, tidak satupun oleh Paus. Semua ini 
diadakan antara gereja-gereja Timur atau Yunani. Tetapi juga dihadiri 
oleh perwakilan dari cabang Barat atau Gereja Romawi.

3. Konsili pertama diadakan di Nicea pada tahun 325 oleh Konstantin dan 
dihadiri oleh 318 uskup.

Kedua di Konstantinopel, tahun 381 oleh Theodosius Agung. Dihadiri oleh 
150 uskup. (Pada awal abad, uskup adalah pastor dari gereja individu.)

Ketiga oleh Theodosius II dan Valentian III. Dihadiri oleh 250 uskup. 
Diadakan di Efesus tahun 431.

Keempat di Calcedon, tahun 451, oleh Kaisar Marian; 500 atau 600 uskup 
atau Metropolitans (pastor kota atau pastor pertama gereja) hadir. Dalam 
konsili inilah doktrin yang dikenal dengan Mariolatry diperkenalkan. Ini 
berarti menyembah kepada Maria, ibu Kristus. Pada awalnya doktrin ini 
menyebabkan perselisihan, banyak penolakan serius. Tapi akhirnya 
dimenangkan sebagai doktrin tetap gereja Katolik.

Kelima diadakan di Konstantinopel (kedua kalinya diadakan di kota ini).
Oleh Justinian pada tahun 553, dan dihadiri oleh 165 uskup. Ini 
sepertinya diadakan hanya untuk mengutuk tulisan tertentu.

Pada tahun 680 konsili keenam diadakan di Konstantinopel oleh Konstantin 
Pegonator, untuk mengutuk kesesatan. Selama pertemuan ini Paus Honorius 
dikeluarkan dan dikucilkan. Tetapi saat ini doktrin infallibility (bahwa 
semua kata Paus adalah kebenaran mutlak) belum dideklarasikan.

Konsili ketujuh diadakan di Nicea tahun 787. Kedua kalinya diadakan di
kota ini. Diadakan oleh Ratu Irene. Disinilah awal permulaannya 
"Penyembahan Gambar/Patung" dan "Penyembahan Orang Kudus". Kita bisa 
melihat disini bahwa mereka bukannya meng-kristenkan, malahan 
'di-pagan-kan' menjadi penyembah berhala.

Konsili Timur terakhir yang diadakan oleh Kaisar, diadakan di 
Konstantinopel tahun 869 oleh Basilius Maredo. Gereja Katolik mendapat 
masalah besar. Timbul perpecahan serius antara kedua cabang Katolik 
Timur dan Barat, Yunani dan Romawi. Pontius Yunani di Konstantinopel dan 
NIcholas I di Roma. Begitu serius masalah mereka, mereka saling 
mengucilkan. Untuk waktu singkat, Katolik tidak mempunyai pemimpin.

Konsili diadakan untuk, apabila memungkinkan, mendamaikan masalah ini. 
Perpecahan ini tidak pernah, hingga saat ini, bisa diselesaikan. Sejak 
saat itulah, semua usaha memperbaiki perpecahan ini gagal. Kekuasaan 
Lateran meningkat. Bukan Kaisar lagi, tetapi Paus Romawi mengadakan 
konsili. Konsili akan dipelajari nanti pada kuliah ini.

4. Satu doktrin baru yang belum kita perhatikan. Pasti banyak yang lain 
tetapi satu ini yaitu "komuni bayi". Bayi tidak saja dibaptis, tetapi 
juga diterima dalam gereja, menjadi anggota gereja dan mereka berhak 
ikut dalam Perjamuan Tuhan. Bagaimana membawa ini kepada mereka adalah 
satu masalah, tetapi diatasi dengan merendam roti didalam anggur. Hal 
ini dilakukan selama bertahun-tahun. Dan setelah beberapa saat doktrin 
yang baru ditambahkan bahwa ini pun salah satu jalan Keselamatan. Juga 
masih ada doktrin baru yang kemudian ditambahkan lagi, akan kita bahas 
kembali nanti.

5. Selama abad kelima, Konsili Ekumene keempat diadakan di Chalcedon 
pada tahun 451, sebuah doktrin baru ditambahkan lagi pada daftar; 
doktrin yang disebut "Mariolatry" atau penyembahan Maria, ibu Yesus. 
Rasanya dibutuhkan seorang perantara baru. Jarak antara Tuhan dan 
manusia terlalu jauh untuk satu perantara saja, walaupun itu Kristus, 
Anak Allah yang menjadi manusia. Gereja mengajarkan Maria dibutuhkan 
sebagai pengantara lagi dan doa kepada Maria. Kemudian Maria membawakan 
kepada Kristus.
(catatan penerjemah: baca 1Timotius 2:5)

6. Dua dokter baru ditambahkan dalam iman Katolik pada abad ke delapan. 
Doktrin ini diumumkan pada Konsili kedua di Nicea, tahun 787. Doktrin 
pertama adalah "Penyembahan Gambar/Patung" yang langsung melawan 
perintah Tuhan.
"Jangan membuat bagimu patung yang menyerupai APAPUN" (Keluaran 20:3-5). 
Satu lagi penambahan dari pagan penyembahan berhala. Kemudian diikuti 
dengan "penyembahan orang kudus". Doktrin ini tidak pernah diajarkan 
dalam Alkitab. Hanya satu kali penyembahan orang kudus ditulis di 
Alkitab dan ini menunjukkan kebodohan orang kaya yang mati dan berdoa 
kepada Abraham, (Luk 16:24-31). Hal ini adalah beberapa penyimpangan 
besar dari pengajaran Perjanjian Baru, sejarah yang terjadi selama 
periode ini.

7. Selama periode ini yang sedang kita pelajari, korban pembantaian 
dinamai dengan banyak nama. Antara lain Donatis, Paterines, Cathari, 
Paulician, dan Ana-Baptis; dan tidak lama kemudian, Petro-Brussians, 
Arnoldis, Henrician, Albigenses, dan Waldenses. Kadang kala satu 
kelompok lebih menyolok dan kadang kala kelompok yang lain. Tetapi salah 
satu dari mereka selalu lebih menonjol karena kesengsaraan penganiayaan 
mereka.

8. Jangan mengira bahwa semua yang dianiaya adalah selalu yang setia 
pada segala pengajaran Perjanjian Baru. Memang pada umumnya begitu. Dan 
beberapa dari mereka sangatlah setia. Ingat bahwa pada jaman mereka 
belum terlalu lama dari jaman Perjanjian Baru atau Perjanjian Lama. Buku 
belum dicetak tetapi tertulis dalam naskah pada perkamen atau kulit atau 
semacam itu, dan ukurannya sangat besar dan berat. Sedikit, jika ada, 
keluarga atau bahkan gereja yang mempunyai salinan lengkap seluruh kitab. 
Sebelum kanon tertutup resmi (akhir abad keempat) mungkin sedikit sekali 
naskah lengkap Perjanjian Baru. Dari seribu naskah yang diketahui, hanya 
ada sekitar 30 salinan yang lengkap.

9. Lagipula, selama "jaman kegelapan" dan periode penganiayaan, usaha 
keras dilakukan untuk menghancurkan naskah Alkitab dan menganiaya 
siapapun yang memilikinya. Karena itu, mereka hanya memiliki sebagian 
kecil dari Alkitab.

10. Perlu dicatat juga bahwa untuk mencegah penyebaran pandangan apapun, 
yang berlawanan dengan Katolik, rencana dan pencegahan dilakukan. 
Pertama, semua tulisan dalam bentuk apapun, selain dari Katolik, 
dikumpulkan dan dibakar. Terutama adalah buku-buku. Selama beberapa abad 
rencana dan pencegahan dilakukan dengan ketat. Karena inilah, alasan 
utama mengapa begitu sulit mengumpulkan sejarah yang akurat. Penulis 
gigih dan pengkotbah pun mati martir. Ini adalah periode sangat berdarah. 
Semua kelompok yang setia akan disebut sesat dan diberi nama yang 
membedakan, dan dimanapun mereka tinggal, mereka dianiaya dengan kejam. 
Donatis, Paulician, yang menonjol pada kelompok awal. Katolik, memang 
sepertinya aneh, menuduh semua yang menolak penyimpangan iman mereka, 
menuduh mereka sesat, dan mengutuk kesesatan mereka. Katolik sendiri 
menjadi semakin 'pagan' dan Yahudi daripada meng-kristenkan, dan 
bergeser kepada kekuasaan sipil daripada kekuatan rohani. Mereka 
menciptakan lebih banyak hukum baru daripada menjalankan yang lama.

11. Berikut beberapa dari banyak variasi dari pengajaran Perjanjian Baru 
selama abad ini. Mungkin tidak selalu diberikan berurutan sejarah. 
Bahkan hampir tidak mungkin mendapatkan waktu tepat mulainya 
penyimpangan ini. Kebanyakan seperti seluruh sistem Katolik. Mereka 
tumbuh berkembang. Terutama pada masa awal, doktrin dan pengajaran 
selalu berubah, bahkan bila tidak pernah terjadi, sebuah Gereja 
Perjanjian Baru



11. The following are a few of the many new variations that came about in New Testament 
teachings during these centuries. They are probably not always given in the order of their 
promulgation. In fact it would sometimes be next to impossible to get the exact date of the origin of 
some of these changes. They have been somewhat like the whole Catholic system. They are growths 
of development. In the earlier years especially, their doctrines or teachings were subject to constant 
changeby addition or subtraction, or substitution or abrogation. The Catholic Church was now no 
longer, even if it had ever been, a real New Testament Church. It no longer was a purely executive 
body, to carry out the already made laws of God, but had become actively legislative, making new 
ones, changing or abrogating old ones at will. 

12. One of their new doctrines or declarations about this time was "There is no salvation outside of 
the Church" the Catholic Church, of course, as they declared there was no other be a Catholic or 
be lost. There was no other alternative. 

13. The doctrine of Indulgences and the Sale of Indulgences was another absolutely new and serious 
departure from New Testament teachings. But in order to make that new teaching really effective, 
still another new teaching was imperatively necessary: A very large Credit Account must somehow 
be established a credit account in heaven, but accessible to earth. So the merit of "good works" as 
a means of Salvation must be taught, and as a means of filling up, putting something in the credit 
account, from which something could be drawn. The first large sum to go into the account in 
heaven was of course the work of the Lord Jesus. As He did no evil, none of His good works were 
needed for Himself, so all His good works could and would of course, go into the credit account. 
And then in addition to that, all the surplus good works (in addition to what each might need for 
himself) by the Apostles, and by all good people living thereafter, would be added to that credit 
account, making it enormously large. And then all this immense sum placed to the credit of the 
church the only church(?)! and permission given to the church to use as needed for some poor 
sinning mortal, and charging for that credit as much as might be thought wise, for each one needed 
the heavenly credit. Hence came the Sale of Indulgences. Persons could buy for themselves or their 
friends, or even dead friends. The prices varied in proportion to the offense committed or to be 
committed. This was sometimes carried to a desperate extreme, as admitted by Catholics 
themselves. Some histories or Encyclopedias give a list of prices charged on different sins for which 
Indulgences were sold. 



14. Yet another new doctrine was necessary, yea imperative, to make thoroughly effective the last 
two. That new doctrine is called Purgatory, a place of intermediate state between heaven and hell, 
at which all must stop to be cleansed from all sins less than damning sins. Even the "Saints" must 
go through purgatory and must remain there until cleansed by fireunless they can get help 
through that credit account, and that they can get only through the prayers or the paying for 
Indulgences, by those living. Hence the Sale of Indulgences. One departure from New Testament 
teachings lead inevitably to others. 

15. It may be well just here to take time to show the differences between the Roman and Greek 
Catholics: 

(1) In the Nationalities: The Greeks mainly are Slavs, embracing Greece, Russia, Bulgaria, 
Serbia, etc., speaking Greek. The Romans are mainly Latins, embracing Italy, France, 
Spain, South and Central America, Mexico etc. 

(2) The Greek Catholics reject sprinkling or pouring for baptism. The Romans use 
sprinkling entirely, claiming the right to change from the original Bible plan of immersion. 

(3) The Greek Catholics continue the practice of Infant Communion. The Romans have 
abandoned it though once taught it as another means of Salvation. 

(4) The Greeks in administering the Lord's Supper give the wine as well as the bread to the 
laity. The Romans give the bread only to the laitythe priests drink the wine. 

(5) The Greeks have their priests to marry. The Roman priests are forbidden to marry. 

(6) The Greeks reject the doctrine of Papal "Infallibility," the Romans accept and insist 
upon that doctrine. The above are at least the main points on which they differ otherwise 
the Greek and Roman Catholic churches, it seems, would stand together. 

16. In our lectures we have just about gotten through with the ninth century. We begin now with 
the tenth. Please note the chart . Just here where the separation has taken place between the Roman 
and Greek Catholics. You will soon see as the centuries advance, other new laws and doctrines and 
other desperately bitter persecution. (Schaff, Herzogg, En., Vol. 11, page 901.) 

"THE TRAIL OF BLOOD" 

17. 1 again call your attention to those upon whom the hard hand of persecution fell. If fifty million 
died of persecution during the 1,200 years of what are called the "Dark Ages," as history seems 
positively to teach then they died faster than an average of four million every one hundred years. 
That seems almost beyond the limit of, human conception. As before mentioned, this iron hand, 
dripping with martyr blood, fell upon Paulicians, Arnoldists, Henricians, Petro Brussians, 
Albigenses, Waldenses and Ana-Baptists of course much harder upon some than others. But this 
horrid part of our story we will pass over hurriedly. 

18. There came now another rather long period of Ecumenical Councils, of course not continuously 
or consecutively. There were all through the years many councils that were not Ecumenical, not 
"Empire Wide." These Councils were largely legislative bodies for the enactment or amendment of 
some civil or religious (?) laws, all of which, both the legislation and the laws, were directly contrary 



to the New Testament. Remember these were the acts of an established churcha church married 
to a Pagan government. And this church has become far more nearly paganized than the 
government has become Christianized. 

19. When any people discard the New Testament as embracing all necessary laws for a Christian 
life, whether for the individual Christian or the whole church, that people has launched upon a 
limitless ocean. Any erroneous law, (and any law added to the Bible is erroneous) will inevitably 
and soon demand another, and others will demand yet others, without ever an end. That is why 
Christ gave His churches and to preachers no legislative powers. And again, and more particularly, 
that is why the New Testament closes with these significant words, 

"For I certify unto every man that heareth the words of this book, if any man shall add unto these 
things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take 
away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of 
life, and out of the Holy City, and from the things which are written in the book." Rev. 22:18, 19. 

NOTE: We insert here this parenthetical clause, as a warning. Let Baptist Churches beware of even 
disciplinary and other varieties of resolutions, which they sometimes pass in their conferences, 
which resolutions might be construed as laws or rules of Church government, The New Testament 
has all necessary laws and rules. 

20. The extreme limit of this little book precludes the possibility of saying much concerning these 
councils or law-making assemblies, but it is necessary to say some things. 

21. The first of these Lateran or Western Councils, those called by the popes, was called by Calixtus 
II, A.D. 1123. There were present about 300 bishops. At this meeting it was decreed that Roman 
priests were never to marry. This was called the Celibacy of the priests. We of course do not 
attempt to give all things done at these meetings. 

22. Years later, 1139 A.D., Pope Innocent II, called another of these Councils especially to condemn 
two groups of very devout Christians, known as Petro-Brussians and Arnoldists. 

23. Alexander III called yet another, A.D. 1179, just forty years after the last. In that was 
condemned what they called the "Errors and Impieties" of the Waldenses and Albigenses. 

24. Just 36 years after this last one, another was called by Pope Innocent III. This was held A.D. 
1215, and seems to have been the most largely attended of possibly any of these great councils. 
According to the historical account of this meeting, "there were present 412 bishops, 800 Abbots 
and priors, Ambassadors from the Byzantine court, and a great number of Princes and Nobles." 
From the very make-up of this assembly you may know that spiritual matters were at least not 
alone to be considered. 

At that time was promulgated the new doctrine of "Transubstantiation," the intended turning of 
the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper into the actual and real body and blood of Christ, after a 
prayer by the priest. This doctrine among others, had much to do with stirring up the leaders of the 
Reformation a few centuries later. This doctrine of course taught that all those who participated in 
the supper actually ate of the body and drank of the blood of Christ. Auricular confession- 
confessing one's sins into the ear of a priest was another new doctrine seemingly having its 
beginning at this meeting. But probably the most cruel and bloody thing ever brought upon any 



people in all the world's history was what is known as the "Inquisition," and other similar courts, 
designed for trying what was called "heresy." The whole world is seemingly filled with books 
written in condemnation of that extreme cruelty, and yet it was originated and perpetuated by a 
people claiming to be led and directed by the Lord. For real barbarity there seems to be nothing, 
absolutely nothing in all history that will surpass it. I would not even attempt to describe it. I will 
simply refer my readers to some of the many books written on the "Inquisition" and let them read 
and study for themselves. And yet another thing was done at this same meeting, as if enough had 
not been done. It was expressly decreed to extirpate all "heresy." What a black page~yea~many 
black pages were written into the world's history by these terrible decrees. 

25. In A.D. 1229, just 14 years after the last awful meeting, still another meeting was held. (This 
seems not to have been ecumenical.) It was called the council at Toulouse. Probably one of the most 
vital matters in all Catholic history was declared at this meeting. At this it was decreed, the Bible, 
God's book, should be denied to all laymen, all members of Catholic churches other than priests or 
higher officials. How strange a law in the face of the plain teaching of the Word, "Search the 
scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me." (John 
5:39) 

26. Yet another Council was called to meet at Lyons. This was called by Pope Innocent TV, in 1245 
A.D. This seems to have been mainly for the purpose of excommunicating and deposing Emperor 
Frederick I of Germany. The Church, the adulterous bride at the marriage with the State in 313 in 
the days of CONST ANTINE THE Great, has now become the head of the house, and is now 
dictating politics of State government, and kings and queens are made or unmade at her pleasure. 

27. In 1274 A.D. another Council was called to bring about the reuniting of the Roman and Greek 
branches of the great Catholic Church. This great assembly utterly failed to accomplish its purpose. 

THIRD LECTURE-1400-1600 

1. These three centuries, fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth, are among the most eventful in all the 
world's history, and especially is this true in Christian history. There was almost a continual 
revolution inside the Catholic Churchboth Roman and Greekseeking a Reformation. This 
awakening of long dormant Conscience and the desire for a genuine reformation really began in the 
thirteenth century or possibly even a little earlier than that. History certainly seems to indicate it. 

2. Let's go back just a little. The Catholic Church by its many departures from New Testament 
teachings, its many strange and cruel laws, and its desperately low state of morals, and its hands 
and clothes reeking with the blood of millions of martyrs, has become obnoxious and plainly 
repulsive to many of its adherents, who are far better than their own system and laws and doctrines 
and practices. Several of its bravest and best and most spiritual priests and other leaders, one by 
one, sought most earnestly to reform many of its most objectionable laws and doctrines and get 
back, at least nearer, to the plain teachings of the New Testament. We give some striking examples. 
Note, not only how far apart and where the reformatory fires began, but note also the leaders in the 
reformation. The leaders were, or had been, all Catholic priests or officials of some kind. There 
was, even yet, a little of good in the much evil. However, at this time there was probably not one 
solitary unmarred doctrine of the New Testament retained in its original purity but now note some 
of the reformers and where they labored. 



3. It is well to note, however, that for many centuries prior to this great reformation period, there 
were a number of noted characters, who rebelled against the awful extremes of the Catholicand 
earnestly sought to remain loyal to the Biblebut their bloody trail was about all that was left of 
them. We come now to study for awhile this most noted period the "Reformation." 

4. From 1320 to 1384 there lived a man in England who attracted world-wide attention. His name 
was John Wycliff. He was the first of the brave fellows who had the courage to attempt a real 
reformation inside the Catholic Church. He is many times referred to in history as "The Morning 
Star of the Reformation." He lived an earnest and effective life. It would really require several 
volumes to contain anything like an adequate history of John Wycliff. He was hated, fearfully 
hated, by the leaders of the Catholic hierarchy. His life was persistently sought. He finally died of 
paralysis. But years later, so great was Catholic hatred, his bones were dug and burned, and his 
ashes scattered upon the waters. 

5. Following tolerably close on the heels of Wycliff came John Huss, 1373-1415, a distinguished son 
from far away Bohemia. His soul had felt and responded to the brilliant light of England's 
"Morning Star." His was a brave and eventful life, but painfully and sadly short. Instead of 
awakening a responsive chord among his Catholic people in favor of a real reformation, he aroused 
a fear and hatred and opposition which resulted in his being burned at the stake a martyr among 
his own people. And yet he was seeking their own good. He loved his Lord and he loved his people. 
However, he was only one of many millions who had thus to die. 

6. Next to John Huss of Bohemia, came a wonderful son of Italy, the marvelously eloquent 
Savonarola, 1452-1498. Huss was burned in 1415, Savonarola was born 37 years later. He, like 
Huss, though a devout Catholic, found the leaders of his people the people of Italy like those of 
Bohemia, against all reformation. But he, by his mighty eloquence, succeeded in awakening some 
conscience and securing a considerable following. But a real reformation in the Hierarchy meant 
absolute ruin to the higher-ups in that organization. So Savonarola, as well as Huss, must die. HE 
TOO WAS BURNED AT THE STAKE. Of all the eloquent men of that great period, Savonarola 
possibly stood head and shoulders above all others. But he was contending against a mighty 
organization and their existence demanded that they fight the reformation, so Savonarola must die. 

7. Of course, in giving the names of the reformers of this period, many names are necessarily to be 
left out. Only those most frequently referred to in history are mentioned here. Following Italy's 
golden tongued orator came a man from Switzerland. Zwingle was born before Savonarola died. He 
lived from 1484 to 1531. The spirit of reformation was beginning now to fill the whole land. Its fires 
are now breaking out faster and spreading more rapidly and becoming most difficult to control. 
This one kindled by Zwingle was not yet more than partially smothered before another, more 
serious than all the rest, had broken out in Germany. Zwingle died in battle. 

8. Martin Luther, probably the most noted of all the fifteenth and sixteenth century reformers, 
lived 1483 to 1546, and as can be seen by the dates, was very nearly an exact contemporary of 
Zwingle. He was born one year earlier and lived fifteen years later. Far more, probably, than 
history definitely states, his great predecessors have in great measure made easier his hard way 
before him. Furthermore, he learned from their hard experience, and then later, and most 
thoroughly from his own, that a genuine reformation inside the Catholic Church would be an utter 
impossibility. Too many reform measures would be needed. One would demand another and others 
demand yet others, and so on and on. 



9. So Martin Luther, after many hard fought battles with the leaders of Catholicism, and aided by 
Melancthon and other prominent Germans, became the founder in 1530, or, about then, of an 
entirely new Christian organization, now known as the Lutheran Church, which very soon became 
the Church of Germany. This was the first of the new organizations to come directly out of Rome 
and renounce all allegiance to the Catholic Mother Church (as she is called) and to continue to live 
thereafter. 

10. Skipping now for a little while, the Church of England, which comes next to the Lutheran in its 
beginnings, we will follow for a little while the Reformation on the Continent. From 1509 to 1564, 
there lived another of the greatest of the reformers. This was John Calvin, a Frenchman, but 
seeming at the time to be living in Switzerland. He was really a mighty man. He was a 
contemporary of Martin Luther for 30 years, and was 22 years old when Zwingle died. Calvin is the 
accredited founder of the Presbyterian church. Some of the historians, however, give that credit to 
Zwingle, but the strongest evidence seems to favor Calvin. Unquestionably the work of Zwingle, as 
well as that of Luther, made much easier the work of Calvin. So in 1541, just eleven years (that 
seems to be the year), after the founding by Luther of the Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian 
Church came into existence. It too, as in the case of the Lutherans, was led by a reformed Catholic 
priest or at least official. These six~Wycliff, Huss, Savonarola, Zwingle, Luther and Calvin, great 
leaders in their great battles for reformation, struck Catholicism a staggering blow. 

11. In 1560, nineteen years after Calvin's first organization in Geneva, Switzerland, John Knox, a 
disciple of Calvin, established the first Presbyterian Church in Scotland, and just thirty-two years 
later, 1592, the Presbyterian became the State Church of Scotland. 

12. During all these hard struggles for Reformation, continuous and valuable aid was given to the 
reformers, by many Ana-Baptists, or whatever other name they bore. Hoping for some relief from 
their own bitter lot, they came out of their hiding places and fought bravely with the reformers, but 
they were doomed to fearful disappointment. They were from now on to have two additional 
persecuting enemies. Both the Lutheran and Presbyterian Churches brought out of their Catholic 
Mother many of her evils, among them her idea of a State Church. They both soon became 
Established Churches. Both were soon in the persecuting business, falling little, if any, short of their 
Catholic Mother. 

"THE TRAIL OF BLOOD" 

Sad and awful was the fate of these long-suffering Ana-Baptists. The world now offered no sure 
place for hiding. Four hard persecutors were now hot on their trail. Surely theirs was a "Trail of 
Blood." 

13. During the same period, really earlier by several years than the Presbyterians, arose yet another 
new denomination, not on the continent, but in England. However, this came about not so much by 
way of reformation (though that evidently made it easier) as by way of a real split or division in the 
Catholic ranks. More like the division in 869, when Eastern Catholics separated from the Western, 
and became from that time on, known in history as the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches. This 
new division came about somewhat in this wise: 

England's king, Henry VIII, had married Catherine of Spain, but unfortunately, after some time 
his somewhat troublesome heart had fallen in love with Anne Boleyn. So he wanted to divorce 
Catherine and marry Annie. Getting a divorce back then was no easy matter. Only the Pope could 



grant it, and he in this case, for special reasons, declined to grant it. Henry was in great distress. 
Being king, he felt he ought to be entitled to follow his own will in the matter. His Prime Minister 
(at that time Thomas Cromwell) rather made sport of the King. Why do you submit to papal 
authority on such matters? Henry followed his suggestion, threw off papal authority and made 
himself head of the Church of England. Thus began the new Church of England. This was 
consummated in 1534 or 1535. At that time there was no change in doctrine, simply a renunciation 
of the authority of the Pope. Henry at heart really never became a Protestant. He died in the 
Catholic faith. 

14. But this split did ultimately result in some very considerable change, or reformation, While a 
reformation within the Catholic Church and under papal authority, as in the case of Luther and 
others, was impossible, it became possible after the division. Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley and others 
led in some marked changes. However, they and many others paid a bloody price for the changes 
when a few years later, Mary, "Bloody Mary," a daughter of the divorced Catherine, came to the 
English throne, and carried the new Church back under the papal power. This fearful and terrific 
reaction ended with the strenuous and bloody five-year reign of Mary. While the heads were going 
under the bloody axe of Mary, hers went with them. The people had gotten, however, a partial taste 
of freedom so when Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne Boleyn (for whom Catherine was divorced), 
became Queen, the Church of England again overthrew papal power and was again re-established. 

15. Thus, before the close of the Sixteenth Century, there were five established Churcheschurches 
backed up by civil governmentsthe Roman and Greek Catholics counted as two; then the Church 
of England; then the Lutheran, or Church of Germany; then the Church of Scotland, now known 
as the Presbyterian. All of them were bitter in their hatred and persecution of the people called 
Ana-Baptists, Waldenses and all other non-established churches, churches which never in any way 
had been connected with the Catholics. Their great help in the struggle for reformation had been 
forgotten, or was now wholly ignored. Many more thousands, including both women and children 
were constantly perishing every day in the yet unending persecutions. The great hope awakened 
and inspired by the reformation had proven to be a bloody delusion. Remnants now find an 
uncertain refuge in the friendly Alps and other hiding places over the world. 

16. These three new organizations, separating from, or coming out of the Catholics, retained many 
of their most hurtful errors, some of which are as follows: 

(1) Preacher-church government (differing in form). 

(2) Church Establishment (Church and State combination). 

(3) Infant BAPTISM 

(4) Sprinkling or Pouring for Baptism. 

(5) Baptismal Regeneration (some at least, and others, if many of their historians are to be 
accredited). 

(6) Persecuting others (at least for centuries). 

17. In the beginning all these established Churches persecuted one another as well as every one else, 
but at a council held at Augsburg in 1555, a treaty of peace, known as the "Peace of Augsburg" was 



signed between the "Catholics" on the one hand, and the "Lutherans" on the other, agreeing not to 
persecute each other. You let us alone, and we will let you alone. For Catholics to fight Lutherans 
meant war with Germany, and for Lutherans to fight or persecute Catholics meant war with all the 
countries where Catholicism predominated. 

"THE TRAIL OF BLOOD" 

18. But persecutions did not then cease. The hated Ana-Baptists (called Baptists today), in spite of 
all prior persecutions, and in spite of the awful fact that fifty million had already died martyr 
deaths, still existed in great numbers. It was during this period that along one single European 
highway, thirty miles distance, stakes were set up every few feet along this highway, the tops of the 
stakes sharpened, and on the top of each stake was placed a gory head of a martyred Ana-Baptist. 
Human imagination can hardly picture a scene so awful! And yet a thing perpetrated, according to 
reliable history, by a people calling themselves devout followers of the meek and lowly Jesus Christ. 

19. Let it be remembered that the Catholics do not regard the Bible as the sole rule and guide of 
faith and life. The claim that it is indeed unerring, but that there are two other things just as much 
so, the "Writings of the Fathers" and the decrees of the Church (Catholic Church) or the 
declarations of the Infallible Pope. 

Hence, there could never be a satisfactory debate between Catholic and Protestant or between 
Catholic and Baptist, as there could never possibly be a basis of final agreement. The Bible alone 
can never settle anything so far as the Catholics are concerned. 

20. Take as an example the question of "Baptism" and the final authority for the act and for the 
mode. They claim that the Bible unquestionably teaches Baptism and that it teaches immersion as 
the only mode. But they claim at the same time that their unerring Church had the perfect right to 
change the mode from immersion to sprinkling but that no others have the right or authority, none 
but the infallible papal authority. 

21. You will note of course, and possibly be surprised at it, that I am doing in these lectures very 
little quoting. I am earnestly trying to do a very hard thing, give to the people the main substance of 
two thousand years of religious history in six hours of time. 

22. It is well just here to call attention to facts concerning the Bible during these awful centuries. 
Remember the Bible was not then in print and there was no paper upon which to have printed even 
if printing had been invented. Neither was there any paper upon which to write it. Parchment, 
dressed goat of sheep skins, or papyrus (some kind of wood pulp), this was the stuff used upon 
which to write. So a book as big as the Bible, all written by hand and with a stylus of some sort, not 
a pen like we use today, was an enormous thing, probably larger than one man could carry. There 
were never more than about thirty complete Bibles in all the world. Many parts or books of the 
Bible like Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, or Acts, or some one of the Epistles, or Revelation or some 
one book of the Old Testament. One of the most outstanding miracles in the whole world's history- 
according to my way of thinking is the nearness with which God's people have thought and 
believed together on the main and vital points of Christianity. Of course God is the only solution. It 
is now a most glorious fact that we can all and each, now have a full copy of the whole Bible and 
each in our own native tongue. 



23. It is well also for us all to do some serious and special thinking on another vital fact concerning 
the Bible. It has already been briefly mentioned in the lecture preceding this, but is so very vital 
that it will probably be wise to refer to it again. It was the action taken by the Catholics at the 
Council of Toulouse, held in 1229 A. D., when they decided to withhold the Bible, the Word of God 
from the vast majority of all their own people, the "Laymen." I am simply stating here just what 
they stated in their great Council. But lately in private a Catholic said to me, "Our purpose in that 
is to prevent their private interpretation of it." Isn't it marvelous that God should write a book for 
the people and then should be unwilling for the people to read it. And yet according to that book the 
people are to stand or fall in the day of judgment on the teachings of that book. No wonder the 
declaration in the book "Search the Scriptures (the book) for in them ye think ye have eternal life. 
And they are they which testify of me." Fearful the responsibility assumed by the Catholics! 

FOURTH LECTURE-17th, 18th, 19th Centuries 

1. This lecture begins with the beginning of the Seventeenth Century (A.D. 1601). We have passed 
very hurriedly over much important Christian history, but necessity his compelled this. 

2. This three-century period begins with the rise of an entirely new denomination. It is right to state 
that some historians give the date of the beginning of the Congregational Church (at first called 
"Independents") as 1602. However, Schaff-Herzogg, in their Encyclopedia, place its beginning far 
back in the sixteenth century, making it coeval with the Lutheran and Presbyterian. In the great 
reformation wave many who went out of the Catholic Church were not satisfied with the extent of 
the reformation led by Luther and Calvin. They decided to repudiate also the preacher rule and 
government idea of the churches and return to the New Testament democratic idea as had been 
held through the fifteen preceding centuries by those who had refused to enter Constantine's 
hierarchy. 

3. The determined contention of this new organization for this particular reform brought down 
upon its head bitter persecution from Catholic, Lutheran, Presbyterian and Church of England 
adherentsall the established churches. However, it retained many other of the Catholic made 
errors, such for instance as infant baptism, pouring or sprinkling for baptism, and later adopted 
and practiced to an extreme degree the church and state idea. And, after refugeeing to America, 
themselves, became very bitter persecutors. 

4. The name "Independents" or as now called "Congregationalists," is derived from their mode of 
church government. Some of the distinguishing principles of the English Congregationalists as 
given in Schaff-Herzogg Encyclopedia are as follows: 

(1) That Jesus Christ is the only head of the church and that the Word of God is its only 
statue book. 

(2) That visible churches are distinct assemblies of Godly men gathered out of the world for 
purely religious purposes, and not to be confounded with the world. 

(3) That these separate churches have full power to choose their own officers and to 
maintain discipline. 

(4) That in respect to their internal management they are each independent of all other 
churches and equally independent of state control. 



5. How markedly different these principles are from Catholicism, or even Lutheranism, or 
Presbyterianism or the Episcopacy of the Church of England. How markedly similar to the Baptists 
of today, and of all past ages, and to the original teachings of Christ and His apostles. 

6. In 1611, the King James English Version of the Bible appeared. Never was the Bible extensively 
given to the people before. From the beginning of the general dissemination of the Word of God 
began the rapid decline of the Papal power, and the first beginnings for at least many centuries, of 
the idea of "religious liberty." 

7. In 1648 came the "Peace of Westphalia." Among other things which resulted from that peace 
pact was the triple agreement between the great denominationsCatholic, Lutheran and 
Presbyterian, no longer to persecute one another. Persecutions among these denominations meant 
war with governments backing them. However, all other Christians, especially the Ana-Baptists, 
were to continue to receive from them the same former harsh treatment, persistent persecution. 

8. During all the seventeenth century, persecutions for Waldenses, Ana-Baptists, and Baptists (in 
some places the "Ana" was now being left off) continued to be desperately severe; in England by 
the Church of England, as John Bunyan and many others could testify; in Germany by the 
Lutherans; in Scotland by the Church of Scotland (Presbyterian); in Italy, in France, and in every 
other place where the papacy was in power, by the Catholics. There is now no peace anywhere for 
those who are not in agreement with the state churches, or some one of them. 

9. It is a significant fact well established in credible history that even as far back as the fourth 
century those refusing to go into the Hierarchy, and refusing to accept the baptism or those 
baptized in infancy, and refusing to accept the doctrine of "Baptismal Regeneration" and 
demanding rebaptism for all those who came to them from the Hierarchy, were called "Ana- 
Baptists." No matter what other names they then bore, they were always referred to as "Ana- 
Baptists." Near the beginning of the sixteenth century, the "Ana" was dropped, and the name 
shortened to simply "Baptist," and gradually all other names were dropped. Evidently, if Bunyan 
had lived in an earlier period his followers would have been called "Bunyanites" or "Ana- 
Baptists." Probably they would have been called by both names as were others preceding him. 

10. The name "Baptist" is a "nickname," and was given to them by their enemies (unless the name 
can be rightfully attributed to them as having been given to them by the Savior Himself, when He 
referred to John as "The Baptist"). To this day, the name has never been officially adopted by any 
group of Baptists. The name, however, has become fixed and is willingly accepted and proudly 
borne. It snugly fits. It was the distinguishing name of the forerunner of Christ, the first to teach the 
doctrine to which the Baptists now hold. 

11. 1 quote a very significant statement from the Schaff- Herzogg Encyclopedia, under "History of 
Baptists in Europe," Vol. 1, page 210, "The Baptists appeared first in Switzerland about 1523, 
where they were persecuted by Zwingle and the Romanists. They are found in the following years, 
1525-1530, with large churches fully organized, in Southern Germany, Tyrol and in middle 
Germany. In all these places persecutions made their lives bitter." 

(Notethat all this is prior to the founding of the Protestant churches Lutheran, Episcopal, or 
Presbyterian.) 

We continue the quotation 



"Moravia promised a home of greater freedom, and thither many Baptists migrated, only to find 
their hopes deceived. After 1534 they were numerous in Northern Germany, Holland, Belgium, and 
the Walloon provinces. They increased even during Alva's rule, in the low countries, and developed 
a wonderful missionary zeal." (Note~"Missionary Zeal." And yet some folks say that the 
"Hardshells" are primitive Baptists.) 

Where did these Baptists come from? They did not come out of the Catholics during the 
Reformation. They had large churches prior to the Reformation. 

12. As a matter of considerable interest, note the religious changes in England as the centuries have 
gone by: 

The Gospel was carried to England by the Apostles and it remained Apostolic in its religion until 
after the organization of the Hierarchy in the beginning of the fourth century, and really for more 
than another century after that. It then came under the power of the Hierarchy which was rapidly 
developing into the Catholic Church. It then remained Catholicthat was the state religion, until 
the split in 1534-1535, during the reign of Henry VIII. It was then called the Church of England. 
Eighteen years later, 1553-1558, during the reign of Queen Mary ("Bloody Mary") England was 
carried back to the Catholics, and a bloody five-years period was this. Then Elizabeth, a half-sister 
of Mary, the daughter of Anna Boleyn, came to the throne, 1558. The Catholics were again 
overthrown, and again the Church of England came into power. And thus things remained for 
almost another century, when the Presbyterian Church came for a short while into the ascendancy, 
and seemed for a while as if it might become the State Church of England as well as that of 
Scotland. However, following the time of Oliver Cromwell, the Church of England came back to 
her own and has remained the established church of England ever since. 

13. Note the gradual softening down of religious matters in England from the hard and bitter 
persecutions of the established church for more than a century. 

(1) The first toleration act came in 1688, one hundred and fifty-four years after the 
beginning of this church. This act permitted the worship of all denominations in England 
except twothe Catholics and the Unitarians. 

(2) The second toleration act came in 1778, eighty-nine years still later. This act included in 
the toleration the Catholics, but still excluded the Unitarians. 

(3) The third toleration act came in 1813, thirty-five years later. This included the 
Unitarians. 

(4) In 1828-1829 came what is known as the "Test Act" which gave the "dissenters" (the 
religionists not in accord with the "Church of England") access to public office and even to 
Parliament. 

(5) In 1836-37 and 1844 came the "Registration" and "Marriage" acts. These two acts made 
legal baptisms and marriages performed by "dissenters." 

(6) The "Reform Bill" came in 1854. This bill opened the doors of Oxford and Cambridge 
Universities to dissenting students. Up to this time no child of a "dissenter" could enter one 
of these great institutions. 



14. Thus has been the march of progress in England toward "Religious Liberty." But it is probably 
correct to state that real religious liberty can never come into any country where there is and is to 
remain an established church. At best, it can only be toleration, which is certainly a long way from 
real religious liberty. As long as one denomination among several in any country is supported by 
the government to the exclusion of all others this favoritism and support of one, precludes the 
possibility of absolute religious liberty and equality. 

15. Very near the beginning of the eighteenth century there were born in England three boys who 
were destined to leave upon the world a deep and unfading impression. These boys were John and 
Charles Wesley, and George Whitfield. 

John and Charles Wesley were born at Epworth (and here comes a suggestion for the name 
Epworth League), the former June 28, 1703, and the latter March 29, 1708. George Whitfield was 
born in Gloucester, December 27, 1714. The story of the lives of these boys cannot be told here, but 
they are well worth being told, and then retold. These three boys became the fathers and founders 
of Methodism. They were all three members of the Church of England, and all studying for the 
ministry; and yet at that time, not one of them converted (which at that time was not unusual 
among the English clergy. Remember, however, that in those days, the parent frequently, if not 
usually, decided on the profession or line of the life to be followed by the boy). But these boys were 
afterwards converted, and genuinely and wonderfully converted. 

16. These men seemed to have no desire to be the founders of a new denomination. But they did 
seem to greatly desire and earnestly strive for a revival of pure religion and a genuine spiritual 
reformation in the Church of England. This they tried in both England and America. The doors of 
their own churches were soon closed against them. Their services were frequently held out in the 
open, or in some private house, or, as especially in the case of Whitfield, in the meeting houses of 
other denominations. Whitfield's great eloquence attracted markedly great attention everywhere he 
went. 

17. The definite date of the founding of the Methodist Church is hard to be determined. 
Unquestionably Methodism is older than the Methodist Church. The three young men were called 
Methodists before they left college. Their first organizations were called "Societies." Their first 
annual conference in England was held in 1744. The Methodist Episcopal Church was officially and 
definitely organized in America, in Baltimore in 1784. Their growth has really been marvelous. But, 
when they came out of the Church of England, or the Episcopal Church, they brought with them a 
number of the errors of the mother and grandmother churches. For instance, as the Episcopacy, or 
preacher-church government. On this point they have had many internal wars and divisions, and 
seem destined to have yet others. Infant Baptism and sprinkling for baptism, etc., but there is one 
great thing which they have, which they did not bring out with them, a genuine case of spiritual 
religion. 

18. September 12, 1788, there was born in Antrim, Ireland, a child, who was destined in the years to 
come, to create quite a religious stir in some parts of the world, and to become the founder of a new 
religious denomination. That child was Alexander Campbell. His father was a Presbyterian 
minister. The father, Thomas Campbell, came to America in 1807. Alexander, his son, who was 
then in college, came later. Because of changed views, they left the Presbyterians and organized an 
independent body, which they called "The Christian Association," known as "The Brush Run 
Church." In 1811, they adopted immersion as baptism and succeeded in persuading a Baptist 
preacher to baptize them, but with the distinct understanding that they were not to unite with the 
Baptist Church. The father, mother, and Alexander were all baptized. In 1813 their independent 



church united with the Red Stone Baptist Association. Ten years later, because of controversy, they 
left that association and joined another. Controversies continued to arise, and they left that 
association. It is fair to say that they had never been Baptists, nor had they so far as any records I 
have seen, to show, ever claimed to be. 

19. It could hardly be fair to Christian history, and especially to Baptist history, to say nothing in 
these lectures about John Bunyan. In some respects, one of the most celebrated men in English 
history and even in world historyJohn Bunyan, a Baptist preacherJohn Bunyan, twelve years in 
Bedford jail John Bunyan the author while confined in jail, of the most celebrated and most widely 
circulated book, next to the Bible, in the whole world. "Pilgrim's Progress" John Bunyan, one of 
the most notable of all examples of the bitterness of Christian persecution. 

And the story of Mary Bunyan, John Bunyan's blind daughter, ought to be in every Sunday School 
library. For many years it was out of print. I think it is now in print again. I almost defy any man or 
woman, boy or girl, to read it and keep dry eyes. 

20. Another thing about which at least a few words should be said in these lectures in concerning 
Wales and the Welch Baptists. One of the most thrilling stories in Christian history is the story of 
the Welch Baptists. The Baptists of the United States owe far most to the Welch Baptists than the 
most of us are conscious. Some whole Baptist churches, fully organized, have migrated in a body 
from Wales to the United States. (Orchard, p. 21-23; Ford, chapt. 2.) 

21. The story of the beginning of Christian work in Wales is strikingly fascinating and from history 
it seems to be true. That history begins in the New Testament (Acts 28:30-31; II Tim. 4:21). The 
story of Claudia and Pudens their visit to Rome their conversion under Paul's preaching, and 
carrying the gospel back to Wales, their homeland, is thrillingly interesting. Paul did this preaching 
in Rome as early as A.D. 63. Soon after that Claudia, Pudens, and others, among them two 
preachers, carried the same gospel into England and especially into Wales. How mightily the Welch 
Baptists have helped the Baptists in America can hardly be estimated. 

LECTURE FIVE-RELIGION IN THE UNITED STATES 

1. Through the Spanish and others of the Latin races, the Catholics as religionists, came to be the 
first representatives of the Christian religion in South and Central America. But in North America, 
except Mexico, they have never strongly predominated. In the territory of what is now the United 
States except in those sections which were once parts of Mexico they have never been strong 
enough, even during the Colonial period to have their religious views established by law. 

2. Beginning with the Colonial period, in the early part of the seventeenth century, the first 
settlements were established in Virginia, and a little later in that territory now known as the New 
England States. Religious, or more properly speaking irreligious persecutions, in England, and on 
the continent, were, at least, among the prime causes which led to the first settlement of the first 
United States Colonies. In some of the groups of immigrants which first came, not including the 
Jamestown group (1607) and those known as the "Pilgrims" (1620), were two groups, one, at least, 
called "Puritans" these were "Congregationalists." Governor Endicott was in control of their 
colony. The other group were Presbyterians. Among these two groups, however, were a number of 
Christians with other views than theirs, also seeking relief from persecution. 

"THE TRAIL OF BLOOD IN AMERICA" 



3. These refugeeing Congregationalists and Presbyterians established different Colonies and 
immediately within their respective territories established by law their own peculiar religious views. 
In other words, "Congregationalism" and "Presbyterianism" were made the legal religious views of 
their colonies. This to the absolute exclusion of all other religious views. Themselves fleeing the 
mother country, with the bloody marks of persecution still upon them and seeking a home of 
freedom and liberty for themselves, immediately upon being established in their own colonies, in 
the new land and having the authority, they deny religious liberty to others, and practice upon them 
the same cruel methods of persecution. Especially did they, so treat the Baptists. 

4. The Southern colonies in Virginia, North and South Carolina were settled mainly by the 
adherents of the Church of England. The peculiar views of the Church were made the established 
religion of these colonies. Thus in the new land of America, where many other Congregationalists, 
Presbyterians and Episcopalians have come seeking the privilege of worshipping God according to 
the dictates of their own consciences, there were soon set up three established churches. No religious 
liberty for any except for those who held governmental authority. The Children of Rome are 
following in the bloody footsteps of their mother. Their own reformation is yet far from complete. 

5. With the immigrants to America came many scattering Baptists (by some still called "Ana- 
Baptists"). There were probably some in every American-bound vessel. They came, however, in 
comparatively small groups, never in large colonies. They would not have been permitted to come 
in that way. But they kept coming. Before the colonies are thoroughly established the Baptists are 
numerous and almost everywhere. But they soon began to feel the heavy hands of the three State 
churches. For the terrible offenses of "preaching the Gospel" and "refusing to have their children 
baptized," "opposing infant baptism," and other like conscientious acts on their part, they were 
arrested, imprisoned, fined, whipped, banished, and their property confiscated, etc. All that here in 
America. From many sources, I give but a few illustrations. 

6. Before the Massachusetts Bay Colony is twenty years old, with the Congregational as the State 
Church, they passed laws against the Baptists and others. The following is a sample of the laws: 

"It is ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons, within this jurisdiction, shall either openly 
condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or go about secretly to seduce others from the 
approbation or use thereof, or shall purposely depart the congregation at the ministration of the 
ordinance . . . after due time and means of convictionevery such person or persons shall be 
sentenced to banishment." This law was enacted especially against the Baptists. 

7. By the Authorities in this colony, Roger Williams and others were banished. Banishment in 
America in those days was something desperately serious. It meant to go and live among the 
Indians. In this case Williams was received kindly and for quite a while lived among the Indians, 
and in after days proved a great blessing to the colony which had banished him. He saved the 
colony from destruction by this same tribe of Indians, by his earnest entreaties in their behalf. In 
this way he returned good for evil. 

8. Roger Williams, later, together with others, some of whom, at least, had also been banished from 
that and other of the colonies among whom was John Clarke, a Baptist preacher, decided to 
organize a colony of their own. As yet they had no legal authority from England to do such a thing, 
but they thought this step wiser under existing conditions than to attempt to live in existing colonies 
with the awful religious restrictions then upon them. So finding a small section of land as yet 
unclaimed by any existing colony they proceeded to establish themselves on that section of land now 



known as Rhode Island. That was in the year 1638, ten years later than the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony, but it was about 25 years later (1663) before they were able to secure a legal charter. 

9. In the year 1651 (?) Roger Williams and John Clarke were sent by. the colony to England to 
secure, if possible legal permission to establish their colony. When they reached England, Oliver 
Cromwell was in charge of the government, but for some reason he failed to grant their request. 
Roger Williams returned home to America. John Clarke remained in England to continue to press 
his plea. Year after year went by. Clarke continued to remain. Finally Cromwell lost his position 
and Charles II sat upon the throne of England. While Charles is regarded in history as one of the 
bitterest of persecutors of Christians, he finally, in 1663, granted that charter. So Clarke, after 12 
long years of waiting returned home with that charter. So in 1663, the Rhode Island colony became 
a real legal institution, and the Baptists could write their own constitution. 

10. That Constitution was written. It attracted the attention of the whole wide world. In that 
Constitution was the world's first declaration of "Religious Liberty." 

The battle for absolute religious liberty even in America alone is a great history within itself. For a 
long time the Baptists seem to have fought that battle entirely alone, but they did not fight it for 
themselves alone, but for all peoples of every religious faith. Rhode Island, the first Baptist colony, 
established by a small group of Baptists after 12 years of earnest pleading for permission was the 
first spot on earth where religious liberty was made the law of the land. The settlement was made in 
1638; the colony legally established in 1663. 

11. In this colony two Baptist churches were organized even prior to the legal establishment of the 
colony. As to the exact date of the organization of at least one of these two churches, even the 
Baptists, according to history, are at disagreement. All seem to be agreed as to the date of the 
organization of the one at Providence, by Roger Williams, in 1639. As to the date of the one 
organized at Newport by John Clarke, all the later testimony seems to give the date at 1638. All the 
earlier seems to give it later, some years later. The one organized by Roger Williams at Providence 
seems to have lived but a few months. The other by John Clarke at Newport, is still living. My own 
opinion as to the date of organization of Newport church, based on all available data, is that 1638 is 
the correct date. Personally, I am sure this date is correct. 

12. As to the persecutions in some of the American colonies, we give a few samples. It is recorded 
that on one occasion one of John Clarke's members was sick. The family lived just across the 
Massachusetts Bay Colony line and just inside that colony. John Clarke, himself, and a visiting 
preacher by the name of Crandall and a layman by the name of Obediah Holmesall three went to 
visit that sick family. While they were holding some kind of a prayer service with that sick family, 
some officer or officers of the colony came upon them and arrested them and later carried them 
before the court for trial. It is also stated, that in order to get a more definite charge against them, 
they were carried into a religious meeting of their church (Congregationalist), their hands being 
tied (so the record states). The charge against them was "for not taking off their hats in a religious 
service." They were all tried and convicted. Gov. Endicott was present. In a rage he said to Clarke, 
while the trial was going on, "You have denied infants baptism" (this was not the charge against 
them). "You deserve death. I will not have such trash brought into my jurisdiction." The penalty 
for all was a fine, or be well-whipped. Crandall's fine (a visitor) was five pounds ($25.00), Clarke's 
fine (the pastor) was twenty pounds ($100.00). Holmes' fine (the records say he had been a 
Congregationalist and had joined the Baptists) so his fine was thirty pounds ($150.00). Clark's and 
Crandall's fines were paid by friends. Holmes refused to allow his fine paid, saying he had done no 
wrong, so was well whipped. The record states that he was "stripped to the waist" and then 



whipped (with some kind of a special whip) until the blood ran down his body and then his legs 
until his shoes overflowed. The record goes on to state that his body was so badly gashed and cut 
that for two weeks he could not lie down, so his body could touch the bed. His sleeping had to be 
done on his hands or elbows and knees. Of this whipping and other things connected with it I read 
all records, even Holmes' statement. A thing could hardly have been more brutal. And here in 
America! 

13. Painter, another man, "refused to have his child baptized," and gave as his opinion "that infant 
baptism was an anti-Christian ordinance." For these offenses he was tied up and whipped. 
Governor Winthrop tells us that Painter was whipped "for reproaching the Lord's ordinance." 

14. In the colony where Presbyterianism was the established religion, dissenters (Baptist and others) 
seemed to fare no better than in the Massachusetts Bay Colony where Congregationalism was the 
established religion. 

In this colony was a settlement of Baptists. In the whole settlement were only five other families. 
The Baptists recognized the laws they were under and were, according to the records, obedient to 
them. This incident occurred: 

It was decided by authorities of the colony to build a Presbyterian meeting house in that Baptist 
settlement. The only way to do it seemed by taxation. The Baptists recognized the authority of the 
Presbyterians to levy this new and extra tax, but they made this plea against the tax at this time-- 
"We have just started our settlement. Our little cabins have just been built, and little gardens and 
patches just been opened. Our fields not cleared. We have just been taxed to the limit to build a fort 
for protection against the Indians. We cannot possibly pay another tax now." This is only the 
substance of their plea. The tax was levied. It could not possibly be paid at that time. An auction 
was called. Sales were made. Their cabins and gardens and patches, and even their graveyards, 
were soldnot their unopened fields. Property valued at 363 pounds and 5 shillings sold for 35 
pounds and 10 shillings. Some of it, at least, was said to have been bought by the preacher who was 
to preach there. The settlement was said to have been left ruined. 

A large book could be filled with oppressive laws. Terrifically burdensome acts of taxation, hard 
dealing of many sorts, directed mainly against the Baptists. But these lectures cannot enter into 
these details. 

15. In the southern colonies, throughout the Carolinas and especially Virginia, where the Church of 
England held sway, persecution of Baptists was serious and continuous. Many times their preachers 
were fined and imprisoned. From the beginning of the colonial period to the opening of the 
Revolutionary War, more than 100 years, these persecutions of Baptists were persisted in. 

16. We give some examples of the hardships of the Baptists in Virginia, and yet strange as it may 
now seem Virginia was the next place on earth after Rhode Island to adopt religious liberty. But 
that was more than a century away. But the hardshipsas many as 30 preachers at different times, 
were put in jail with the only charge against them "for preaching the Gospel of the Son of God." 
James Ireland is a case in point. He was imprisoned. After imprisonment, his enemies tried to blow 
him up with gunpowder. That having failed, they next tried to smother him to death by burning 
sulphur under his windows at the jail. Failing also in this, they tried to arrange with a doctor to 
poison him. All this failed. He continued to preach to his people from the windows. A wall was then 
built around his jail so the people could not see in nor he see out, but even that difficulty was 



overcome. The people gathered, a handkerchief was tied to a long stick, and that stuck up above the 
walls so Ireland could see when they were ready. The preaching continued. 

17. Three Baptist preachers (Lewis and Joseph Craig and Aaron Bledsoe) were later arrested on 
the same charge. One of them, at least, was a blood relative of R. E. B. Baylor, and possibly of one 
or more other Texas Baptist preachers. These preachers were arraigned for trial. Patrick Henry, 
hearing of it and though living many miles away and though a Church of England man himself, 
rode those miles horseback to the trial and volunteered his services in their defense. Great was his 
defense. I cannot enter into a description of it here. It swept the court. The preachers were freed. 

18. Elsewhere than Rhode Island, religious liberty came slowly and by degrees. For example: In 
Virginia a law was passed permitting one, but only one, Baptist preacher to a county. He was 
permitted to preach but once in two months. Later this law was modified, permitting him to preach 
once in each month. But even then, in only one definite place in the county, and only one sermon on 
that day, and never to preach at night. Laws were passed not only in Virginia but in colonies 
elsewhere positively forbidding any Mission work. This was why Judson was the first foreign 
missionarylaw forbade. It took a long time and many hard battles, in the Virginia House of 
Burgesses, to greatly modify these laws. 

19. Evidently, one of the greatest obstructions to religious liberty in America, and probably all over 
the world as to that, was the conviction which had grown into the people throughout the preceding 
centuries that religion could not possibly live without governmental support. That no denomination 
could prosper solely on voluntary offerings by its adherents. And this was the hard argument to 
meet when the battle was raging for the disestablishment of the Church of England in Virginia, and 
also later in Congress when the question of religious liberty was being discussed there. For a long 
time the Baptists fought the battle almost alone, 

20. Rhode Island began her colony in 1638, but it was not legally chartered until 1663. There was 
the first spot where Religious Liberty was granted. The second place was Virginia in 1786. Congress 
declared the first amendment to the Constitution to be in force December 15, 1791, which granted 
religious liberty to all citizens, Baptists are credited with being the leaders in bringing this blessing 
to the nation. 

21. We venture to give one early Congressional incident. The question of whether the United States 
should have an established church or several established churches, or religious liberty, was being 
discussed. Several different bills had been offered, one recommending the Church of England as the 
established church; and another the Congregationalist Church, and yet another the Presbyterian. 
The Baptists, many of them, though probably none of them members of Congress, were earnestly 
contending for absolute religious liberty. James Madison (afterwards President) seemingly was 
their main supporter. Patrick Henry arose and offered a substitute bill for them all, "That four 
churches (or denominations) instead of one be established" the Church of England, or Episcopal, 
Congregationalist, Presbyterian, and the Baptist. Finally when each of the others saw that IT could 
not be made the sole established church, they each agreed to accept Henry's compromise. (This 
compromise bill stated that each person taxed would have the right to say to which denomination of 
these four his money should go.) The Baptists continued to fight against it all; that any combination 
of Church and State was against their fundamental principles, that they could not accept it even if 
voted. Henry pleaded with them, said he was trying to help them, that they could not live without it, 
but they still protested. The vote was taken it carried nearly unanimously. But the measure had to 
be voted on three times. The Baptists, led by Madison and possibly others continued to fight. The 
second vote came. It also carried almost unanimously, swept by Henry's masterful eloquence. But 



the third vote had yet to be taken. Now God seemingly intervened. Henry was made Governor of 
Virginia and left Congress. When the third vote came, deprived of Henry's irresistible eloquence, 
the vote was lost. 

Thus the Baptists came near being an established denomination over their own most solemn 
protest. This is not the only opportunity the Baptists ever had of becoming established by law, but is 
probably the nearest they ever came to it. 

22. Not long after this, the Church of England was entirely disestablished in America. No religious 
denomination was supported by the Central Government (a few separated State governments still 
had establishment), Church and state, so far as the United States was concerned, were entirely 
separated. These two, Church and State, elsewhere at least, had for 1,500 years (since 313) been 
living in unholy wedlock. Religious Liberty was, at least here in the United States, resurrected to die 
no more, and now gradually but in many places slowly, it is spreading throughout the world. 

23. But even in the United States, the Church and State idea died hard. It lingered on in several of 
the separate States, long after Religious Liberty had been put into the Constitution of the United 
States. Massachusetts, where the Church and State idea first found a lodging place in America, has, 
as already stated, finally given it up. It had lived there over two and one-half centuries. Utah is the 
last lingering spot left to disfigure the face of the first and greatest nation on earth to adopt and 
cherish "Religious Liberty." Remember there can be no real and absolute Religious liberty in any 
nation where the Government gives its support to one special religious denomination. 

24. Some serious questions have many times been asked concerning the Baptists: Would they, as a 
denomination, have accepted from any nation or state an offer of "establishment" if such nation or 
state had freely made them such an offer? And, would they, in case they had accepted such an offer, 
have become persecutors of others like Catholics or Episcopals, or Lutherans or Presbyterians, or 
Congregationalists? Probably a little consideration of such questions now would not be amiss. Have 
the Baptists, as a fact, ever had such an opportunity? 

Is it not recorded in history, that on one occasion, the King of the Netherlands (the Netherlands at 
that time embracing Norway and Sweden, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark) had under serious 
consideration the question of having an established religion? Their kingdom at that period was 
surrounded on almost all sides by nations or governments with established religionsreligions 
supported by the Civil Government. 

It is stated that the King of Holland appointed a committee to examine into the claims of all existing 
churches or denominations to see which had the best claim to be the New Testament Church. The 
committee reported back that the Baptists were the best representatives of New Testament 
teachings. Then the King offered to make the Baptist "the established" church or denomination of 
his kingdom. The Baptists kindly thanked him but declined, stating that it was contrary to their 
fundamental convictions and principles. 

But this was not the only opportunity they ever had of having their denomination the established 
religion of a people. They certainly had that opportunity when Rhode Island Colony was founded. 
And to have persecuted othersthat would have been an impossibility if they were to continue being 
Baptists. They were the original advocates of "Religious Liberty." That really is one of the 
fundamental articles of their religious faith. They believed in the absolute separation of church and 
state. 



25. So strong has been the Baptist conviction on the question of Church and State combination, that 
they have invariably declined all offers of help from the State. We give here two instances. One in 
Texas and the other in Mexico. Long years ago in the days of Baylor University's babyhood, Texas 
offered to help her. She declined the help though she was in distressing need. The Texas Methodists 
had a baby school in Texas at the same time. They accepted the State help; that school finally fell 
into the hands of the State. 

The case in Mexico occurred in this wise: W. D. Powell was our missionary to Mexico. By his 
missionary work he had made a great impression for the Baptists upon Governor Madero of the 
State of Coahuila. Madero offered a great gift to the Baptists from the State, if the Baptists would 
establish a good school in the State of Coahuila, Mexico. The matter was submitted by Powell to the 
Foreign Board. The gift was declined because it was to be from the State. Afterwards Madero gave 
a good large sum personally. That was accepted and Madero Institute was built and established. 

SOME AFTER WORDS 

1. During every period of the "Dark Ages" there were in existence many Christians and many 
separate and independent Churches, some of them dating back to the times of the Apostles, which 
were never in any way connected with the Catholic Church. They always wholly rejected and 
repudiated the Catholics and their doctrines. This is a fact clearly demonstrated by credible history. 

2. These Christians were the perpetual objects of bitter and relentless persecution. History shows 
that during the period of the "Dark Ages," about twelve centuries, beginning with A.D. 426, there 
were about fifty millions of these Christians who died martyr deaths. Very many thousands of 
others, both preceding and succeeding the "Dark Ages," died under the same hard hand of 
persecution. 

3. These Christians, during these dark days of many centuries, were called by many different 
names, all given to them by their enemies. These names were sometimes given because of some 
specially prominent and heroic leader and sometimes from other causes; and sometimes, yea, many 
times, the same people, holding the same views, were called by different names in different 
localities. But amid all the many changes of names, there was one special name or rather 
designation, which clung to at least some of these Christians, throughout all the "Dark Ages," that 
designation being "Ana-Baptist." This compound word applied as a designation of some certain 
Christians was first found in history during the third century; and a suggestive fact soon after the 
origin of Infant Baptism, and a more suggestive fact even prior to the use of the name Catholic. 
Thus the name "Ana-Baptists" is the oldest denominational name in history. 

4. A striking peculiarity of these Christians was and continued to be in succeeding centuries: They 
rejected the man-made doctrine of "Infant Baptism" and demanded rebaptism, even though done 
by immersion for all those who came to them, having been baptized in infancy. For this peculiarity 
they were called "Ana-Baptists." 

5. This, special designation was applied to many of these Christians who bore other nicknames; 
especially is this true of the Donatists, Paulicians, Albigenses and Ancient Waldenses and others. In 
later centuries this designation came to be a regular name, applied to a distinct group. These were 
simply called "Ana- Baptists" and gradually all other names were dropped. Very early in the 
sixteenth century, even prior to the origin of the Lutheran Church, the first of all the Protestant 
Churches, the word "ana" was beginning to be left off, and they were simply called "Baptists." 



6. Into the "dark ages" went a group of many churches which were never in any way identified with 
the Catholics. Out of the "dark ages" came a group of many churches, which had never been in any 
way identified with the Catholics. 

The following are some of the fundamental doctrines to which they held when they went in: And the 
same are, the fundamental doctrines to which they held when they came out: And the same are the 
fundamental doctrines to which they now hold. 

FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES 

1. A spiritual Church, Christ its founder, its only head and law giver. 

2. Its ordinances, only two, Baptism and the Lord's Supper. They are typical and memorial, not 
saving. 

3. Its officers, only two, bishops or pastors and deacons; they are servants of the church. 

4. Its Government, a pure Democracy, and that executive only, never legislative. 

5. Its laws and doctrines: The New Testament and that only. 

6. Its members. Believers only, they saved by grace, not works, through the regenerating power of 
the Holy Spirit. 

7. Its requirements. Believers on entering the church to be baptized, that by immersion, then 
obedience and loyalty to all New Testament laws. 

8. The various churches separate and independent in their execution of laws and discipline and in 
their responsibilities to God but cooperative in work. 

9. Complete separation of Church and State. 

10. Absolute Religious liberty for all.
