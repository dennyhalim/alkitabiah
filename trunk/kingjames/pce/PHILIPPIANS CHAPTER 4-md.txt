# PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 4
>
>Php 4:1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.
>
>Php 4:2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
>
>Php 4:3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
>
>Php 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.
>
>Php 4:5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.
>
>Php 4:6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
>
>Php 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
>
>Php 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.
>
>Php 4:9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
>
>Php 4:10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
>
>Php 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.
>
>Php 4:12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
>
>Php 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
>
>Php 4:14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
>
>Php 4:15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
>
>Php 4:16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
>
>Php 4:17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
>
>Php 4:18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
>
>Php 4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
>
>Php 4:20 Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
>
>Php 4:21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
>
>Php 4:22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
>
>Php 4:23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
>
>Php  [It was written to the Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus.]
