# JAMES CHAPTER 2
>
>Jas 2:1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons.
>
>Jas 2:2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
>
>Jas 2:3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
>
>Jas 2:4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
>
>Jas 2:5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
>
>Jas 2:6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
>
>Jas 2:7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
>
>Jas 2:8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
>
>Jas 2:9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
>
>Jas 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.
>
>Jas 2:11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
>
>Jas 2:12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
>
>Jas 2:13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
>
>Jas 2:14 What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
>
>Jas 2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
>
>Jas 2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit?
>
>Jas 2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
>
>Jas 2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
>
>Jas 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
>
>Jas 2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
>
>Jas 2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
>
>Jas 2:22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
>
>Jas 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
>
>Jas 2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
>
>Jas 2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?
>
>Jas 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
