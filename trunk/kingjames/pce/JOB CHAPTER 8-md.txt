# JOB CHAPTER 8
>
>Job 8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
>
>Job 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these [things]? and [how long shall] the words of thy mouth [be like] a strong wind?
>
>Job 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
>
>Job 8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
>
>Job 8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
>
>Job 8:6 If thou [wert] pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
>
>Job 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
>
>Job 8:8 For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
>
>Job 8:9 (For we [are but of] yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth [are] a shadow:)
>
>Job 8:10 Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
>
>Job 8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
>
>Job 8:12 Whilst it [is] yet in his greenness, [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] herb.
>
>Job 8:13 So [are] the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
>
>Job 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a spider's web.
>
>Job 8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
>
>Job 8:16 He [is] green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
>
>Job 8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, [and] seeth the place of stones.
>
>Job 8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee.
>
>Job 8:19 Behold, this [is] the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
>
>Job 8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect [man], neither will he help the evil doers:
>
>Job 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
>
>Job 8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
