# PROVERBS CHAPTER 5
>
>Pr 5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, [and] bow thine ear to my understanding:
>
>Pr 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and [that] thy lips may keep knowledge.
>
>Pr 5:3  For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, and her mouth [is] smoother than oil:
>
>Pr 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
>
>Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
>
>Pr 5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them].
>
>Pr 5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
>
>Pr 5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
>
>Pr 5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
>
>Pr 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours [be] in the house of a stranger;
>
>Pr 5:11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
>
>Pr 5:12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
>
>Pr 5:13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
>
>Pr 5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
>
>Pr 5:15  Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
>
>Pr 5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, [and] rivers of waters in the streets.
>
>Pr 5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
>
>Pr 5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
>
>Pr 5:19 [Let her be as] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
>
>Pr 5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
>
>Pr 5:21 For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
>
>Pr 5:22  His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
>
>Pr 5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
