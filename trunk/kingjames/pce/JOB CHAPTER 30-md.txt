# JOB CHAPTER 30
>
>Job 30:1 But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
>
>Job 30:2 Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?
>
>Job 30:3 For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
>
>Job 30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat.
>
>Job 30:5 They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)
>
>Job 30:6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.
>
>Job 30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
>
>Job 30:8 [They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
>
>Job 30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
>
>Job 30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
>
>Job 30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
>
>Job 30:12 Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
>
>Job 30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
>
>Job 30:14 They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me].
>
>Job 30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
>
>Job 30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
>
>Job 30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
>
>Job 30:18 By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
>
>Job 30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
>
>Job 30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not].
>
>Job 30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
>
>Job 30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.
>
>Job 30:23 For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.
>
>Job 30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
>
>Job 30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?
>
>Job 30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
>
>Job 30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
>
>Job 30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation.
>
>Job 30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
>
>Job 30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
>
>Job 30:31 My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
