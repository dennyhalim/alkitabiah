>
>Job 21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
>
>Job 21:9 Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God upon them.
>
>Job 21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
>

>
>Job 21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it].
>
>Job 21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
>
>Job 21:21 For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
>
>Job 21:22 Shall [any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
>
>Job 21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
>
>Job 21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
>
>Job 21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.

>
>Job 21:30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
>
>Job 21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him [what] he hath done?
