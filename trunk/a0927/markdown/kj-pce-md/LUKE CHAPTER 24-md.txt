# LUKE CHAPTER 24
>
>Lu 24:1 Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.
>
>Lu 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
>
>Lu 24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
>
>Lu 24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
>
>Lu 24:5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
>
>Lu 24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
>
>Lu 24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
>
>Lu 24:8 And they remembered his words,
>
>Lu 24:9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
>
>Lu 24:10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
>
>Lu 24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
>
>Lu 24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
>
>Lu 24:13  And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.
>
>Lu 24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
>
>Lu 24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
>
>Lu 24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
>
>Lu 24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications [are] these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
>
>Lu 24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
>
>Lu 24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
>
>Lu 24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
>
>Lu 24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
>
>Lu 24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
>
>Lu 24:23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
>
>Lu 24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
>
>Lu 24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
>
>Lu 24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
>
>Lu 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
>
>Lu 24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
>
>Lu 24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
>
>Lu 24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.
>
>Lu 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
>
>Lu 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
>
>Lu 24:33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
>
>Lu 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
>
>Lu 24:35 And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
>
>Lu 24:36  And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.
>
>Lu 24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
>
>Lu 24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
>
>Lu 24:39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
>
>Lu 24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.
>
>Lu 24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
>
>Lu 24:42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
>
>Lu 24:43 And he took [it], and did eat before them.
>
>Lu 24:44 And he said unto them, These [are] the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and [in] the prophets, and [in] the psalms, concerning me.
>
>Lu 24:45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
>
>Lu 24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
>
>Lu 24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
>
>Lu 24:48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
>
>Lu 24:49  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
>
>Lu 24:50  And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
>
>Lu 24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
>
>Lu 24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
>
>Lu 24:53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
