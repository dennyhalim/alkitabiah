# JOB CHAPTER 5
>
>Job 5:1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
>
>Job 5:2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
>
>Job 5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
>
>Job 5:4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither [is there] any to deliver [them].
>
>Job 5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
>
>Job 5:6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
>
>Job 5:7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
>
>Job 5:8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
>
>Job 5:9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
>
>Job 5:10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
>
>Job 5:11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
>
>Job 5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform [their] enterprise.
>
>Job 5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
>
>Job 5:14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
>
>Job 5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
>
>Job 5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
>
>Job 5:17 Behold, happy [is] the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
>
>Job 5:18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
>
>Job 5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
>
>Job 5:20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
>
>Job 5:21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
>
>Job 5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
>
>Job 5:23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
>
>Job 5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle [shall be] in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
>
>Job 5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed [shall be] great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
>
>Job 5:26 Thou shalt come to [thy] grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
>
>Job 5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it [is]; hear it, and know thou [it] for thy good.
