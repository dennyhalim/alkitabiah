# HEBREWS CHAPTER 3
>
>Heb 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
>
>Heb 3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.
>
>Heb 3:3 For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
>
>Heb 3:4 For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.
>
>Heb 3:5 And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
>
>Heb 3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
>
>Heb 3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
>
>Heb 3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
>
>Heb 3:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
>
>Heb 3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.
>
>Heb 3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
>
>Heb 3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
>
>Heb 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
>
>Heb 3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
>
>Heb 3:15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
>
>Heb 3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
>
>Heb 3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
>
>Heb 3:18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
>
>Heb 3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
