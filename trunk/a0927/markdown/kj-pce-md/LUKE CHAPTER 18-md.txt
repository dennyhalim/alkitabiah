# LUKE CHAPTER 18
>
>Lu 18:1 And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
>
>Lu 18:2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:
>
>Lu 18:3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
>
>Lu 18:4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
>
>Lu 18:5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
>
>Lu 18:6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
>
>Lu 18:7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?
>
>Lu 18:8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
>
>Lu 18:9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
>
>Lu 18:10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
>
>Lu 18:11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
>
>Lu 18:12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
>
>Lu 18:13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
>
>Lu 18:14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
>
>Lu 18:15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.
>
>Lu 18:16 But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
>
>Lu 18:17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
>
>Lu 18:18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
>
>Lu 18:19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.
>
>Lu 18:20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
>
>Lu 18:21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
>
>Lu 18:22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
>
>Lu 18:23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.
>
>Lu 18:24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
>
>Lu 18:25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
>
>Lu 18:26 And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?
>
>Lu 18:27 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
>
>Lu 18:28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
>
>Lu 18:29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
>
>Lu 18:30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
>
>Lu 18:31  Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
>
>Lu 18:32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
>
>Lu 18:33 And they shall scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.
>
>Lu 18:34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
>
>Lu 18:35  And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
>
>Lu 18:36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
>
>Lu 18:37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
>
>Lu 18:38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
>
>Lu 18:39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.
>
>Lu 18:40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,
>
>Lu 18:41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
>
>Lu 18:42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.
>
>Lu 18:43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.
