# JAMES CHAPTER 4
>
>Jas 4:1 From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even] of your lusts that war in your members?
>
>Jas 4:2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
>
>Jas 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon your lusts.
>
>Jas 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
>
>Jas 4:5 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
>
>Jas 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
>
>Jas 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
>
>Jas 4:8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [ye] double minded.
>
>Jas 4:9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.
>
>Jas 4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
>
>Jas 4:11 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of [his] brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
>
>Jas 4:12 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
>
>Jas 4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
>
>Jas 4:14 Whereas ye know not what [shall be] on the morrow. For what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
>
>Jas 4:15 For that ye [ought] to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
>
>Jas 4:16 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
>
>Jas 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.
