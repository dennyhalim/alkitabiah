# JOB CHAPTER 22
>
>Job 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
>
>Job 22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
>
>Job 22:3 [Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or [is it] gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?
>
>Job 22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
>
>Job 22:5 [Is] not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
>
>Job 22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
>
>Job 22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
>
>Job 22:8 But [as for] the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
>
>Job 22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
>
>Job 22:10 Therefore snares [are] round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
>
>Job 22:11 Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
>
>Job 22:12 [Is] not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
>
>Job 22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
>
>Job 22:14 Thick clouds [are] a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
>
>Job 22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
>
>Job 22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
>
>Job 22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
>
>Job 22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good [things]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
>
>Job 22:19 The righteous see [it], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
>
>Job 22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
>
>Job 22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
>
>Job 22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
>
>Job 22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
>
>Job 22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
>
>Job 22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
>
>Job 22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
>
>Job 22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
>
>Job 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
>
>Job 22:29 When [men] are cast down, then thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
>
>Job 22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
