# JOB CHAPTER 31
>
>Job 31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
>
>Job 31:2 For what portion of God [is there] from above? and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
>
>Job 31:3 [Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to the workers of iniquity?
>
>Job 31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
>
>Job 31:5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
>
>Job 31:6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
>
>Job 31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
>
>Job 31:8 [Then] let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
>
>Job 31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or [if] I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
>
>Job 31:10 [Then] let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
>
>Job 31:11 For this [is] an heinous crime; yea, it [is] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges.
>
>Job 31:12 For it [is] a fire [that] consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
>
>Job 31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
>
>Job 31:14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
>
>Job 31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
>
>Job 31:16 If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
>
>Job 31:17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
>
>Job 31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
>
>Job 31:19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
>
>Job 31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
>
>Job 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
>
>Job 31:22 [Then] let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
>
>Job 31:23 For destruction [from] God [was] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
>
>Job 31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;
>
>Job 31:25 If I rejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
>
>Job 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness;
>
>Job 31:27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
>
>Job 31:28 This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] above.
>
>Job 31:29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
>
>Job 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
>
>Job 31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
>
>Job 31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.
>
>Job 31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
>
>Job 31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door?
>
>Job 31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire [is, that] the Almighty would answer me, and [that] mine adversary had written a book.
>
>Job 31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, [and] bind it [as] a crown to me.
>
>Job 31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
>
>Job 31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
>
>Job 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
>
>Job 31:40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
