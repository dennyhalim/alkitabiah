# PROVERBS CHAPTER 23
>
>Pr 23:1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what [is] before thee:
>
>Pr 23:2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou [be] a man given to appetite.
>
>Pr 23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they [are] deceitful meat.
>
>Pr 23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
>
>Pr 23:5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
>
>Pr 23:6 Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath] an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
>
>Pr 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart [is] not with thee.
>
>Pr 23:8 The morsel [which] thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.
>
>Pr 23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
>
>Pr 23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
>
>Pr 23:11 For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
>
>Pr 23:12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
>
>Pr 23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
>
>Pr 23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
>
>Pr 23:15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
>
>Pr 23:16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
>
>Pr 23:17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [be thou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
>
>Pr 23:18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
>
>Pr 23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
>
>Pr 23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
>
>Pr 23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags.
>
>Pr 23:22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
>
>Pr 23:23 Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
>
>Pr 23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall have joy of him.
>
>Pr 23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
>
>Pr 23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
>
>Pr 23:27 For a whore [is] a deep ditch; and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.
>
>Pr 23:28 She also lieth in wait as [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.
>
>Pr 23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
>
>Pr 23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
>
>Pr 23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright.
>
>Pr 23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
>
>Pr 23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
>
>Pr 23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
>
>Pr 23:35 They have stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they have beaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
