# PROVERBS CHAPTER 6
>
>Pr 6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
>
>Pr 6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
>
>Pr 6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
>
>Pr 6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
>
>Pr 6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
>
>Pr 6:6  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
>
>Pr 6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
>
>Pr 6:8 Provideth her meat in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.
>
>Pr 6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
>
>Pr 6:10 [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
>
>Pr 6:11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
>
>Pr 6:12  A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
>
>Pr 6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
>
>Pr 6:14 Frowardness [is] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
>
>Pr 6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
>
>Pr 6:16  These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven [are] an abomination unto him:
>
>Pr 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
>
>Pr 6:18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
>
>Pr 6:19 A false witness [that] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
>
>Pr 6:20  My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
>
>Pr 6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, [and] tie them about thy neck.
>
>Pr 6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
>
>Pr 6:23 For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the law [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:
>
>Pr 6:24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
>
>Pr 6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
>
>Pr 6:26 For by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
>
>Pr 6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
>
>Pr 6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
>
>Pr 6:29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
>
>Pr 6:30 [Men] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
>
>Pr 6:31 But [if] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
>
>Pr 6:32 [But] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
>
>Pr 6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
>
>Pr 6:34 For jealousy [is] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
>
>Pr 6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
