# PROVERBS CHAPTER 8
>
>Pr 8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
>
>Pr 8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
>
>Pr 8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
>
>Pr 8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice [is] to the sons of man.
>
>Pr 8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
>
>Pr 8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips [shall be] right things.
>
>Pr 8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.
>
>Pr 8:8 All the words of my mouth [are] in righteousness; [there is] nothing froward or perverse in them.
>
>Pr 8:9 They [are] all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
>
>Pr 8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
>
>Pr 8:11 For wisdom [is] better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
>
>Pr 8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
>
>Pr 8:13 The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
>
>Pr 8:14 Counsel [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I [am] understanding; I have strength.
>
>Pr 8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
>
>Pr 8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, [even] all the judges of the earth.
>
>Pr 8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
>
>Pr 8:18 Riches and honour [are] with me; [yea], durable riches and righteousness.
>
>Pr 8:19 My fruit [is] better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
>
>Pr 8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
>
>Pr 8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
>
>Pr 8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
>
>Pr 8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
>
>Pr 8:24 When [there were] no depths, I was brought forth; when [there were] no fountains abounding with water.
>
>Pr 8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
>
>Pr 8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
>
>Pr 8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I [was] there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
>
>Pr 8:28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
>
>Pr 8:29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
>
>Pr 8:30 Then I was by him, [as] one brought up [with him]: and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him;
>
>Pr 8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights [were] with the sons of men.
>
>Pr 8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed [are they that] keep my ways.
>
>Pr 8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
>
>Pr 8:34 Blessed [is] the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
>
>Pr 8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
>
>Pr 8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
