# GENESIS CHAPTER 6
>
>Ge 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
>
>Ge 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they [were] fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
>
>Ge 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
>
>Ge 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown.
>
>Ge 6:5  And GOD saw that the wickedness of man [was] great in the earth, and [that] every imagination of the thoughts of his heart [was] only evil continually.
>
>Ge 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
>
>Ge 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
>
>Ge 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
>
>Ge 6:9  These [are] the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man [and] perfect in his generations, [and] Noah walked with God.
>
>Ge 6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
>
>Ge 6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
>
>Ge 6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
>
>Ge 6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
>
>Ge 6:14  Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
>
>Ge 6:15 And this [is the fashion] which thou shalt make it [of]: The length of the ark [shall be] three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
>
>Ge 6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; [with] lower, second, and third [stories] shalt thou make it.
>
>Ge 6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein [is] the breath of life, from under heaven; [and] every thing that [is] in the earth shall die.
>
>Ge 6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
>
>Ge 6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every [sort] shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep [them] alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
>
>Ge 6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every [sort] shall come unto thee, to keep [them] alive.
>
>Ge 6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather [it] to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
>
>Ge 6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
