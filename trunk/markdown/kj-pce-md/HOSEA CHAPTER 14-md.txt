>Ho 14:1 O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
>
>Ho 14:2 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.
>
>Ho 14:3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
>
>Ho 14:4  I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.
>
>Ho 14:5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
>
>Ho 14:6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
>
>Ho 14:7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof [shall be] as the wine of Lebanon.
>
>Ho 14:8 Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard [him], and observed him: I [am] like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.
>
>Ho 14:9 Who [is] wise, and he shall understand these [things]? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD [are] right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.
