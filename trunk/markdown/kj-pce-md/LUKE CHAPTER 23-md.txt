# LUKE CHAPTER 23
>
>Lu 23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
>
>Lu 23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
>
>Lu 23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest [it].
>
>Lu 23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.
>
>Lu 23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
>
>Lu 23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
>
>Lu 23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
>
>Lu 23:8  And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
>
>Lu 23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
>
>Lu 23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
>
>Lu 23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
>
>Lu 23:12  And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
>
>Lu 23:13  And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
>
>Lu 23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
>
>Lu 23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
>
>Lu 23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].
>
>Lu 23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
>
>Lu 23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:
>
>Lu 23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
>
>Lu 23:20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
>
>Lu 23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.
>
>Lu 23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.
>
>Lu 23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
>
>Lu 23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
>
>Lu 23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
>
>Lu 23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.
>
>Lu 23:27  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
>
>Lu 23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
>
>Lu 23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
>
>Lu 23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
>
>Lu 23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
>
>Lu 23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
>
>Lu 23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
>
>Lu 23:34  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
>
>Lu 23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
>
>Lu 23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
>
>Lu 23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
>
>Lu 23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
>
>Lu 23:39  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
>
>Lu 23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
>
>Lu 23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
>
>Lu 23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
>
>Lu 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
>
>Lu 23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
>
>Lu 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
>
>Lu 23:46  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
>
>Lu 23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
>
>Lu 23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
>
>Lu 23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
>
>Lu 23:50  And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counseller; [and he was] a good man, and a just:
>
>Lu 23:51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
>
>Lu 23:52 This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
>
>Lu 23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
>
>Lu 23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
>
>Lu 23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
>
>Lu 23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
