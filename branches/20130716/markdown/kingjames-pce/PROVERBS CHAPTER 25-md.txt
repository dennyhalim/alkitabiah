>
>Pr 25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great [men]:
>
>Pr 25:7 For better [it is] that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
>
>Pr 25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
>
>Pr 25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour [himself]; and discover not a secret to another:

>
>Pr 25:11 A word fitly spoken [is like] apples of gold in pictures of silver.
>
>Pr 25:12 [As] an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, [so is] a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

>
>Pr 25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
>
>Pr 25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
>
>Pr 25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and [so] hate thee.
>
>Pr 25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour [is] a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
>
>Pr 25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble [is like] a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
>
>Pr 25:20 [As] he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon nitre, so [is] he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
>
>Pr 25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
>
>Pr 25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
>
>Pr 25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so [doth] an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
>
>Pr 25:24 [It is] better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
>
>Pr 25:25 [As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so [is] good news from a far country.
>
>Pr 25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked [is as] a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
>
>Pr 25:27 [It is] not good to eat much honey: so [for men] to search their own glory [is not] glory.
>
>Pr 25:28 He that [hath] no rule over his own spirit [is like] a city [that is] broken down, [and] without walls.
