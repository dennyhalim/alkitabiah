# ROMANS CHAPTER 9
>
>Ro 9:1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
>
>Ro 9:2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
>
>Ro 9:3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
>
>Ro 9:4 Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises;
>
>Ro 9:5 Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
>
>Ro 9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they [are] not all Israel, which are of Israel:
>
>Ro 9:7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, [are they] all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
>
>Ro 9:8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
>
>Ro 9:9 For this [is] the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.
>
>Ro 9:10 And not only [this]; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac;
>
>Ro 9:11 (For [the children] being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
>
>Ro 9:12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
>
>Ro 9:13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
>
>Ro 9:14 What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
>
>Ro 9:15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
>
>Ro 9:16 So then [it is] not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
>
>Ro 9:17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
>
>Ro 9:18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will [have mercy], and whom he will he hardeneth.
>
>Ro 9:19 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
>
>Ro 9:20 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed [it], Why hast thou made me thus?
>
>Ro 9:21 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
>
>Ro 9:22 [What] if God, willing to shew [his] wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
>
>Ro 9:23 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
>
>Ro 9:24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
>
>Ro 9:25 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
>
>Ro 9:26 And it shall come to pass, [that] in the place where it was said unto them, Ye [are] not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
>
>Ro 9:27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
>
>Ro 9:28 For he will finish the work, and cut [it] short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
>
>Ro 9:29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
>
>Ro 9:30 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
>
>Ro 9:31 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
>
>Ro 9:32 Wherefore? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
>
>Ro 9:33 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
