# ROMANS CHAPTER 12
>
>Ro 12:1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.
>
>Ro 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
>
>Ro 12:3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
>
>Ro 12:4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
>
>Ro 12:5 So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
>
>Ro 12:6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;
>
>Ro 12:7 Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
>
>Ro 12:8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
>
>Ro 12:9 [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
>
>Ro 12:10 [Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
>
>Ro 12:11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
>
>Ro 12:12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
>
>Ro 12:13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
>
>Ro 12:14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
>
>Ro 12:15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
>
>Ro 12:16 [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
>
>Ro 12:17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
>
>Ro 12:18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
>
>Ro 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
>
>Ro 12:20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
>
>Ro 12:21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
