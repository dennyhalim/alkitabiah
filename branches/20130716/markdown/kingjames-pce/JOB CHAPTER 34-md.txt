# JOB CHAPTER 34
>
>Job 34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
>
>Job 34:2 Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
>
>Job 34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
>
>Job 34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.
>
>Job 34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
>
>Job 34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.
>
>Job 34:7 What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?
>
>Job 34:8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
>
>Job 34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
>
>Job 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.
>
>Job 34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.
>
>Job 34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
>
>Job 34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
>
>Job 34:14 If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
>
>Job 34:15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
>
>Job 34:16 If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
>
>Job 34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
>
>Job 34:18 [Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?
>
>Job 34:19 [How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.
>
>Job 34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
>
>Job 34:21 For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
>
>Job 34:22 [There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
>
>Job 34:23 For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.
>
>Job 34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
>
>Job 34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.
>
>Job 34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
>
>Job 34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
>
>Job 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
>
>Job 34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:
>
>Job 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
>
>Job 34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:
>
>Job 34:32 [That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
>
>Job 34:33 [Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
>
>Job 34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
>
>Job 34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.
>
>Job 34:36 My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.
>
>Job 34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
