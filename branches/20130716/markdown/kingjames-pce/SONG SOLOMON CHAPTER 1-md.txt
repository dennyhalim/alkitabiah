>
>Song 1:5 I [am] black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
>
>Song 1:6 Look not upon me, because I [am] black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; [but] mine own vineyard have I not kept.
>
>Song 1:7 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest [thy flock] to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
>
>Song 1:8  If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.

>
>Song 1:14 My beloved [is] unto me [as] a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.
>
>Song 1:15 Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves' eyes.
>
>Song 1:16 Behold, thou [art] fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed [is] green.
>
