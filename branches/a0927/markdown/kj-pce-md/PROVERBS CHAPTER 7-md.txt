# PROVERBS CHAPTER 7
>
>Pr 7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
>
>Pr 7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
>
>Pr 7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
>
>Pr 7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:
>
>Pr 7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.
>
>Pr 7:6  For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
>
>Pr 7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
>
>Pr 7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
>
>Pr 7:9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
>
>Pr 7:10 And, behold, there met him a woman [with] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
>
>Pr 7:11 (She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
>
>Pr 7:12 Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
>
>Pr 7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with an impudent face said unto him,
>
>Pr 7:14 [I have] peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
>
>Pr 7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
>
>Pr 7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.
>
>Pr 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
>
>Pr 7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
>
>Pr 7:19 For the goodman [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:
>
>Pr 7:20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed.
>
>Pr 7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
>
>Pr 7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
>
>Pr 7:23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.
>
>Pr 7:24  Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
>
>Pr 7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
>
>Pr 7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong [men] have been slain by her.
>
>Pr 7:27 Her house [is] the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
