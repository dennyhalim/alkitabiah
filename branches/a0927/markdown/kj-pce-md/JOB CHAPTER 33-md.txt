# JOB CHAPTER 33
>
>Job 33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
>
>Job 33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
>
>Job 33:3 My words [shall be of] the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
>
>Job 33:4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
>
>Job 33:5 If thou canst answer me, set [thy words] in order before me, stand up.
>
>Job 33:6 Behold, I [am] according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
>
>Job 33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
>
>Job 33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying],
>
>Job 33:9 I am clean without transgression, I [am] innocent; neither [is there] iniquity in me.
>
>Job 33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
>
>Job 33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
>
>Job 33:12 Behold, [in] this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
>
>Job 33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
>
>Job 33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, [yet man] perceiveth it not.
>
>Job 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
>
>Job 33:16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
>
>Job 33:17 That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, and hide pride from man.
>
>Job 33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
>
>Job 33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong [pain]:
>
>Job 33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
>
>Job 33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.
>
>Job 33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
>
>Job 33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
>
>Job 33:24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
>
>Job 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
>
>Job 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
>
>Job 33:27 He looketh upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;
>
>Job 33:28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
>
>Job 33:29 Lo, all these [things] worketh God oftentimes with man,
>
>Job 33:30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
>
>Job 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
>
>Job 33:32 If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
>
>Job 33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
