# JOB CHAPTER 9
>
>Job 9:1 Then Job answered and said,
>
>Job 9:2 I know [it is] so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
>
>Job 9:3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
>
>Job 9:4 [He is] wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened [himself] against him, and hath prospered?
>
>Job 9:5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
>
>Job 9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
>
>Job 9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
>
>Job 9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
>
>Job 9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
>
>Job 9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
>
>Job 9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
>
>Job 9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
>
>Job 9:13 [If] God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
>
>Job 9:14 How much less shall I answer him, [and] choose out my words [to reason] with him?
>
>Job 9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer, [but] I would make supplication to my judge.
>
>Job 9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; [yet] would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
>
>Job 9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
>
>Job 9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
>
>Job 9:19 If [I speak] of strength, lo, [he is] strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time [to plead]?
>
>Job 9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: [if I say], I [am] perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
>
>Job 9:21 [Though] I [were] perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
>
>Job 9:22 This [is] one [thing], therefore I said [it], He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
>
>Job 9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
>
>Job 9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, [and] who [is] he?
>
>Job 9:25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
>
>Job 9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle [that] hasteth to the prey.
>
>Job 9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort [myself]:
>
>Job 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
>
>Job 9:29 [If] I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
>
>Job 9:30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
>
>Job 9:31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
>
>Job 9:32 For [he is] not a man, as I [am, that] I should answer him, [and] we should come together in judgment.
>
>Job 9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, [that] might lay his hand upon us both.
>
>Job 9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
>
>Job 9:35 [Then] would I speak, and not fear him; but [it is] not so with me.
